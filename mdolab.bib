 abstract = {The Multi-points Expected Improvement criterion (or {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-EI) has recently been studied in batch-sequential Bayesian Optimization. This paper deals with a new way of computing {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-EI, without using Monte-Carlo simulations, through a closed-form formula. The latter allows a very fast computation of {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-EI for reasonably low values of {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}(typically, less than 10). New parallel kriging-based optimization strategies, tested on different toy examples, show promising results.},

 abstract = {Multi-objectives and multi-constraints problems are a big challenge in the industry, and they are also difficult to be conquered by traditional methods. In this situation, heuristic algorithms become an executable choice when facing this kind of problems. In this paper, we introduce the complex system which is more complicated than normal multi-objectives and multi-constraints problems. For each family of systems, the objective functions and constraints are normally shared among families. Since keeping the certain number of objective functions and constraints for the entire population is no longer a realistic situation in today's industry, it is time to find a new algorithm to deal with complex system. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a newly developed heuristic algorithm, and with the promising and consistent performance in [1], [2] and [3], it becomes a strong competitor in this area. In this paper, BBO will be applied to the complex system families for the system optimization.},

Exploring different combinations of terms, we derive 52 approximations for computing the first order derivatives and 43 for the second order derivatives. For an appropriate combination of terms and appropriate choice of the step size in real and imaginary direction, 4 t h order accuracy can be achieved in a very simple and efficient scheme on a compact stencil. New different ways of computing second order derivatives in one single step are shown. Many of the first order derivative approximations avoid the problem of subtractive cancellation inherent to the classic finite difference approximations for real valued steps, and the superior accuracy and stability of the generalized Complex Step approximations is demonstrated for an analytic test function.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an efficient optimization process, where the parameters defining the features in a feature-based CAD model are used as design variables. The process exploits adjoint methods for the computation of gradients, and as such the computational cost is essentially independent of the number of design variables, making it ideal for optimization in large design spaces. The novelty of this paper lies in linking the adjoint surface sensitivity information with geometric sensitivity values, referred to as design velocities, computed for CAD models created in commercial CAD systems (e.g. CATIA V5 or Siemens NX). This process computes gradients based on the CAD feature parameters, which are used by the optimization algorithm, which in turn updates the values of the same parameters in the CAD model. In this paper, the design velocity and resulting gradient calculations are validated against analytical and finite-difference results. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be compatible with different commercial CAD packages and computational fluid dynamics solvers.},

@inproceedings{AGray2021a,
 abstract = {Over the past decade, advances in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) have enabled the optimization of aircraft wings using high-fidelity simulations of their coupled aerodynamic and structural behavior. However, as their aspect-ratios increase, these wings increasingly exhibit geometrically nonlinear behavior that cannot be correctly modeled by typical linear structural analysis methods. Although many low-fidelity aeroelastic analysis and optimization tools feature geometrically nonlinear finite element models, all examples to date of high-fidelity aerostructural optimization have been restricted to linear finite element models due to concerns over computational cost and complexity. In this work, we develop a tool for high-fidelity, geometrically nonlinear structural and aerostructural optimization and demonstrate it by performing detailed structural sizing optimization of a high aspect-ratio wingbox using high-fidelity RANS CFD and a geometrically nonlinear shell finite element formulation. By comparing the results of aerostructural analysis and optimization using both geometrically linear and nonlinear structural finite element formulations, we find that geometric nonlinearity results in a 5-10% increase in the bending stress and optimized structural mass of the wingbox. Geometrically nonlinear analysis not only results in deflected wing shapes and lift distributions which are more physically accurate, but also captures new loading phenomena within the wingbox, both of which lead to more realistic structural sizing. We also show that the increase in computational cost when optimizing with geometrically nonlinear analysis can be as low as 15%, meaning these formulations should not be viewed as prohibitively expensive.

adjointmethod is sensitive to the number of
constraints, and, therefore, the adjoint method
bene? ts from constraint lumping. A continuum
version of the Kreisselmeier--Steinhauser functional
is chosen to lumpconstraints. The adjoint and direct

Significant performance enhancement was achieved by attaching wings to the first stage for providing aerodynamic assist. Optimization was performed by varying the geometric definition of the attached wings and core vehicle design parameters. Significant decreases in initial system weights and propellant mass fractions were achieved for a given payload with the addition of wing structure. These final results are presented in the form of effective specific impulse boost for the aerodynamically assisted vehicle.},

 abstract = {Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms have been applied with success to multi-objective optimization problems where they are broken into several subproblems, and solutions for the original problem are recognized in a coordinated manner. Motivated by the working principle of decomposition-based methods, viz. the ``divide-and-conquer'' paradigm; this paper is concerned with solving black-box multi-objective problems given a finite number of function evaluations by taking inspiration from the single-objective deterministic sampling method, DIRECT. In particular, we provide a multi-objective algorithmic instance of DIRECT, which we refer to as MO-DIRECT and investigate its performance with respect to established decomposition-based multi-objective techniques. Besides its asymptotic convergence to the Pareto front and its inherent balance between exploration and exploitation of the decision space, the proposed framework is flexible enough to incorporate indicator-based techniques, albeit at the cost of a greater space complexity when compared to the evolutionary counterpart.},

 abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) gives rise to nonlinear optimization problems characterized by a large number of constraints that naturally occur in blocks. We propose a class of multilevel optimization methods motivated by the structure and number of constraints and by the expense of the derivative computations for MDO. The algorithms are an extension ot the nonlinear programming problem of the successful class of local Brown-Brent algorithms for nonlinear equations. Our extensions allow the user to partition constraints into arbitrary blocks to fit the application, and they separately process each block and the objective function, restricted to certain subspaces. The methods use trust regions as a globalization strategy, and they have been shown to be globally convergent under reasonable assumptions. The multilevel algorithms can be applied to all classes of MDO formulations. Multilevel algorithms for solving nonlinear systems of equations are a special case of the multilevel optimization methods. In this case, they can be viewed as a trust-region globalization of the Brown-Brent class.},

@book{Allgower2003a,
 abstract = {This book was intended as an introduction to the topic of numerical continuation which would be accessible to a readership of widely varying mathematical backgrounds. Realizing the close relationship which exists between the predictor-corrector and the piecewise linear continuation approaches, we attempted to present both methods in a unified way. In the belief that potential users of numerical continuation methods would create programs adapted to their particular needs, we presented pseudo codes and Fortran codes merely as illustrations. Indeed, there are now many specialized packages for treating such varied problems as bifurcation, polynomial systems, eigenvalues, economic equilibria, optimization, and the approximation of manifolds. It was gratifying to hear from students and young colleagues that they had learned from the book in seminars and had used it as a guidebook to write codes tailored to their needs. We hope that this edition can continue to serve such a purpose. Although the original book contained a comprehensive bibliography for its time, a great deal of new literature and software has since appeared. Indeed, for this preface we must content ourselves with an updating of the literature by giving a partial listing of books, survey articles, and conference proceedings dealing with numerical continuation methods and their applications. These sources themselves contain many additional references. Similarly, concerning software, we present several URLs from which readers can hopefully proceed to look for codes which may meet their needs. Remarkably, essentially all of the books treating numerical continuation and/or bifurcation listed in the original bibliography are presently out of print, e.g., Garcia and Zangwill [14], H. B. Keller [20], Rheinboldt [31], and Todd [37]. Only the book by Seydel [35] treating bifurcation and stability analysis is still available. Govaerts has recently authored a monograph [16] on numerical bifurcation of dynamical systems. This book has an extensive bibliography. A somewhat more numerically oriented book has been written by Kuznetsov [22]. Among the conference proceedings treating various aspects of numerical continuation including bifurcation, homotopy methods, and exploiting symmetry are [1, 2, 6, 19, 26, 30, 36]. Homotopy continuation methods for solving polynomial systems over complex numbers has been a very active topic. This is surveyed in the papers by Li [24, 25].},

 abstract = {An aerodynamic design algorithm for
turbulent flows using unstructured grids is described. The current
approach uses adjoint (costate) variables to obtain derivatives of the
cost function. The solution of the adjoint equations is obtained by
using an implicit formulation in which the turbulence model is fully
coupled with the flow equations when solving for the costate variables.
The accuracy of the derivatives is demonstrated by comparison with
finite-difference gradients and a few sample computations are shown. In addition,
a user interface is described that significantly reduces the time
required to set up the design problems. Recommendations on directions of
further research into the Navier-Stokes design process are made.},

@article{Arumugam2013aa,
 abstract = {Fiber reinforced composite materials are used as structural material in airplanes because of their high specific stiffness and strength. When composite materials are subjected to mechanical loading, it leads to many types of failures such as matrix cracking, debonding, delamination, and fiber breakage. To create a better understanding of the initiation, growth and interaction of the different types of damage, damage monitoring during mechanical loading is very important. Acoustic emission is a suitable technique for the detection of a wide range of micro-structural failures in composite materials. In this present paper, GFRP composite laminates with different stacking sequences such as {$[$}0$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4, {$[$}90$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4, angle ply {$[$}$\pm$45$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4 and cross ply {$[$}0$\,^{\circ}$/90$\,^{\circ}${$]$}4 are used to trigger different failure mechanisms when subjected to flexural test (three-point bending) with AE monitoring. Discrimination of the failure modes are done based on the predominance of the failure modes in each orientation. Parametric plots are used to discriminate the modes of fracture within the laminates. Range of frequency content in each orientation is investigated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. FFT enables calculating the frequency content of each damage mechanism. Short Time FFT highlights the possible failure mechanisms associated with each signal. Continuous wavelet transform allowed identifying frequency range and time history for failure modes in each signal. The predominance of failure modes in each orientation is used as a key in the study of discrimination of failure modes in composite laminates.},

 abstract = {Constrained optimization of high-dimensional numerical problems plays an important role in many scientific and industrial applications. Function evaluations in many industrial applications are severely limited and often only little analytical information about objective function and constraint functions is available. For such expensive black-box optimization tasks, the constraint optimization algorithm COBRA (Constrained Optimization By Radial Basis Function Approximation) was proposed, making use of RBF (radial basis function) surrogate modeling for both objective and constraint functions. COBRA has shown remarkable success in solving reliably complex benchmark problems in less than 500 function evaluations. Unfortunately, COBRA requires careful adjustment of parameters in order to do so. In this work we present a new algorithm SACOBRA (Self-Adjusting COBRA), which is based on COBRA and capable of achieving high-quality results with very few function evaluations and no parameter tuning. It is shown with the help of performance profiles on a set of benchmark problems (G-problems, MOPTA08) that SACOBRA consistently outperforms COBRA algorithms with different fixed parameter settings. We analyze the importance of the new elements in SACOBRA and show that each element of SACOBRA plays a role to boost up the overall optimization performance. We discuss the reasons and get in this way a better understanding of high-quality RBF surrogate modeling.},

 abstract = {Summary
The design of swept wings has now reached the stage where a coherent set of aerodynamic principles has emerged. The purpose of this paper is to summarize these principles, and to indicate methods of designing wings in accordance with them. It is important to design wings so that the type of flow obtained in practice is the same as that assumed in the design theory, and so that it is a flow which is usable---i.e. which can be predicted and controlled. It is shown that these requirements lead to the concept of a sub-critical flow which can be obtained on certain swept wings. These are restricted to a fairly narrow band of sweep angles, depending on the design Mach number, and the aspect ratio and thickness of the wings are correspondingly limited. Practical design methods are discussed in order to illustrate the physical principles used in design, but a critical comparison of different calculation methods is not attempted.},

Here, algorithmic differentiation (AD) is applied to the open-source CAD kernel Open CASCADE Technology using the AD software tool ADOL-C (Automatic Differentiation by OverLoading in C++). The differentiated CAD kernel is coupled with a discrete adjoint CFD solver, thus providing the first example of a complete differentiated design chain built from generic, multi-purpose tools. The design chain is demonstrated on the gradient-based optimization of a squared U-bend turbo-machinery cooling duct to minimize the total pressure loss.},

This article proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm to overcome these challenges, based on an adaptive, scalable model that identifies useful combinatorial structure even when data is scarce. Our acquisition function pioneers the use of semidefinite programming to achieve efficiency and scalability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this algorithm consistently outperforms other methods from combinatorial and Bayesian optimization.},

It also discusses some of the most recent developments in that area since the introduction of approximation concepts in the mid-seventies. The paper distinguishes between local, medium-range and global approximations; it covers function approximations and problem approximations. It shows that, although the lack of comparative data established on reference test cases prevents an accurate assessment, there have been significant improvements. The largest number of developments have been in the areas of local function approximations and use of intermediate variable and response quantities. It appears also that some new methodologies emerge which could greatly benefit from the introduction of new computer architectures.},

 abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin methods have proven to be very well suited for the construction of robust high order accurate numerical schemes on arbitrary unstructured and possibly non conforming grids for a wide variety of applications. These accurate, flexibile and robust methods are however rather expensive in terms of computational cost. In this paper we propose to address the issue of computational efficiency of discontinuous finite element methods by introducing a ``multiorder'' discontinuous Galerkin solution strategy which is similar to a multigrid techinque but uses progressively lower order polynomial DG approximations on the same grid instead of the same discretization on progressively coarsened grids. We present the results obtained in the numerical solution of the Euler equations for the subsonic flow around a circle which give some indication of the effectiveness ot the proposed multiorder solution strategy.},

This approach makes use of a deterministic algorithm to suggest, among a list of commercially available system devices, the optimal number and type of units ensuring that the total cost of the system is minimized while guaranteeing the availability of the energy. The collection of 6 months of data of wind speed, solar radiation and ambient temperature recorded for every hour of the day were used. The mathematical modeling of the main elements of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel system is exposed showing the more relevant sizing variables. A deterministic algorithm is used to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the load demand. A comparison between the total cost of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system with batteries and the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system without batteries is presented. The reached results demonstrate the practical utility of the used sizing methodology and show the influence of the battery storage on the total cost of the hybrid system.},

 abstract = {Challenges in the scalable solution of large-scale optimization problems include the
development of innovative algorithms and efficient tools for parallel data
manipulation. This paper discusses two complementary toolkits from the
collection of Advanced CompuTational Software (ACTS), namely, Global Arrays
(GA) for parallel data management and the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization
(TAO), which have been integrated to support large-scale scientific applications
of unconstrained and bound constrained minimization problems. Most likely
to benefit are minimization problems arising in classical molecular dynamics,
free energy simulations, and other applications where the coupling among variables
requires dense data structures. TAO uses abstractions for vectors and matrices
so that its optimization algorithms can easily interface to distributed data
management and linear algebra capabilities implemented in the GA library. The
GA/TAO interfaces are available both in the traditional library mode and as
components compliant with the Common Component Architecture (CCA). We highlight
the design of each toolkit, describe the interfaces between them, and demonstrate
their use.},

 abstract = { Physical interactions between a fluid and structure, potentially manifested as self-sustained or divergent oscillations, can be sensitive to many parameters whose values are uncertain. Of interest here are aircraft aeroelastic interactions, which must be accounted for in aircraft certification and design. Deterministic prediction of these aeroelastic behaviors can be difficult owing to physical and computational complexity. New challenges are introduced when physical parameters and elements of the modeling process are uncertain. By viewing aeroelasticity through a nondeterministic prism, where key quantities are assumed stochastic, one may gain insights into how to reduce system uncertainty, increase system robustness, and maintain aeroelastic safety. This article reviews uncertainty quantification in aeroelasticity using traditional analytical techniques not reliant on computational fluid dynamics; compares and contrasts this work with emerging methods based on computational fluid dynamics, which target richer physics; and reviews the state of the art in aeroelastic optimization under uncertainty. Barriers to continued progress, for example, the so-called curse of dimensionality, are discussed. },

The Moth class uses a twin T-Foil design, one on the centreboard for primary support and one on the rudder for additional support and control. The rudder T-Foil forms the basis of an experimental study carried out at the Australian Maritime College towing tank facility described here. Lift and drag data is presented for upright and heeled configurations considered indicative of windward sailing conditions. Force variation with respect to angle of incidence, depth of submergence and onset flow speed is presented using elliptical lift distribution parameters for easy design use. In addition deflection of the strut run-up was attempted to produce additional lift. Finally, a windward sailing condition prone to ventilation has been identified.},

 abstract = {We compare different block preconditioners in the context of parallel time adaptive higher order implicit time integration using Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov (JFNK) solvers for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the three dimensional time dependent Navier--Stokes equations. A special emphasis of this work is the performance for a relative high number of processors, i.e. with a low number of elements on the processor. For high order DG discretizations, a particular problem that needs to be addressed is the size of the blocks in the Jacobian. Thus, we propose a new class of preconditioners that exploits the hierarchy of modal basis functions and introduces a flexible order of the off-diagonal Jacobian blocks. While the standard preconditioners `block Jacobi' (no off-blocks) and full symmetric Gauss--Seidel (full off-blocks) are included as special cases, the reduction of the off-block order results in the new scheme ROBO-SGS. This allows us to investigate the impact of the preconditioner's sparsity pattern with respect to the computational performance. Since the number of iterations is not well suited to judge the efficiency of a preconditioner, we additionally consider CPU time for the comparisons.

 abstract = {Derivatives of mathematical functions play a key role in various areas of numerical and technical computing. Many of these computations are done in MATLAB, a popular environment for technical computing providing engineers and scientists with capabilities for mathematical computing, analysis, visualization, and algorithmic development. For functions written in the MATLAB language, a novel software tool is proposed to automatically transform a given MATLAB program into another MATLAB program capable of computing not only the original function but also user-specified derivatives of that function. That is, a program transformation known as automatic differentiation is performed to change the semantics of the program in a fashion based on the chain rule of differential calculus. The crucial ingredient of the tool is a combination of source-to-source transformation and operator overloading. The overall design of the tool is described and numerical experiments are reported demonstrating the efficiency of the resulting code for a sample problem.},

For simple functions, symbolic differentiation--done either manually or with a computer algebra system--can provide the derivatives, whereas divided differences (DD) have been used traditionally for functions defined by (potentially very complex) computer programs, even if only approximate values can be obtained this way. An alternative approach for such functions is automatic differentiation (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often lower cost than DD, and without restrictions on the program complexity. In this paper we compare the functionality and describe the use of ADMIT/ADMAT and ADiMat. These two AD tools provide derivatives for programs written in the MATLAB language, which is widely used for prototype and production software in scientific and engineering applications. While ADMIT/ADMAT implements a pure operator overloading approach of AD, ADiMat also employes source transformation techniques.},

 abstract = {Electric propulsion (EP) systems offer considerably more degrees of freedom (DOFs) within the design process of aircraft compared to conventional aircraft engines. This requires large, computationally expensive design space explorations (DSE) with coupled models of the single components to incorporate interdependencies during optimization. The purpose of this paper is to exemplarily study these interdependencies of system key performance parameters (KPIs), e.g., system mass and efficiency, for a varying DC link voltage level of the power transmission system considering the example of the propulsion system of the CENTRELINE project, including an electric motor, a DC/AC inverter, and the DC power transmission cables. Each component is described by a physically derived, analytical model linking specific subdomains, e.g., electromagnetics, structural mechanics and thermal analysis, which are used for a coupled system model. This approach strongly enhances model accuracy and simultaneously keeps the computational effort at a low level. The results of the DSE reveal that the system KPIs improve for higher DC link voltage despite slightly inferior performance of motor and inverter as the mass of the DC power transmission cable has a major share for a an aircraft of the size as in the CENTRELINE project. Modeling of further components and implementation of optimization strategies will be part of future work.},

A small system of equations, only involving the boundary nodes, has to be solved and no grid-connectivity information is needed. The method can handle large mesh deformations caused by translations, rotations and deformations, both for 2D and 3D meshes. However, the performance depends on the used RBF. The best accuracy and robustness with the highest efficiency are obtained with a C2 continuous RBF with compact support, closely followed by the thin plate spline. The deformed meshes are suitable for flow computations as is shown by performing calculations around a NACA-0012 airfoil.},

 abstract = {The application of gradient-based optimization to wing design could potentially reveal revolutionary new wing concepts. Giving the optimizer the freedom to discover novel wing designs may increase the likelihood of multimodality in the design space. To address this issue, we investigate the existence and possible sources of multimodality in the aerodynamic shape optimization of a rectangular wing. Our test case, specified by the ADODG Case 6, has a high dimensionality design space and a large degree of flexibility within that design space. We study several subproblems of this benchmark test case and analyze the multimodality introduced by each set of variables considering both inviscid and viscous analysis. This methodical approach allows us to isolate a few instances where certain parametrizations create a multimodal design space. However, we demonstrate that these occurrences of multimodality are either due to modeling inaccuracies or can be curbed by the application of practical design constraints. Additionally, we find that the shape of the optimized wing is highly dependent on the interplay between induced and parasite drag, providing more incentive to consider viscous effects in the analysis. As an example, when minimizing drag with respect to chord distribution, there are multiple local minima at low CL , but a single global minimum (the elliptical planform) at high CL . These results will help other researchers to avoid some of the pitfalls that could lead to multimodality in wing optimization.},

 abstract = {The Aerion AS2 is poised to make supersonic transportation viable and drastically reduce transoceanic travel time. The design of a supersonic transport aircraft is challenging because experience with this type of aircraft is scarce. Achieving the required range at supersonic speeds requires a refined design with the best combination of aerodynamic and structural performance. Adequate transonic cruise performance is also required due to mission segments overland. To address these issues, we perform CFD-based aerostructural design of the Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet configuration. The aerostructural optimization simultaneously varies structural sizing and wing shape variables to maximize a combination of supersonic and transonic cruise ranges. We examine the design trades between these two ranges by generating sets of Pareto-optimal designs. Optimizations that include wing planform design variables achieve the best design trades, but maximizing supersonic range is particularly challenging. Overall, these initial results show that CFD-based multidisciplinary design optimization is fast enough that we can perform this type of extensive design exploration before the detailed design stage.},

@article{Bons2020d,
 abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) has been previously applied to aerostructural wing design problems with great success.
Most previous applications involve fine-tuning a well-designed aircraft wing. In this work, we broaden the scope of the optimization problem by exploring the design space of aerostructural wing design optimization.
We start with a rectangular wing and optimize the aerodynamic shape and the sizing of the internal structure to achieve minimum fuel burn on a transonic cruise mission. We use a multi-level optimization procedure to decrease computational cost by 40%. We demonstrate that the optimization can transform the rectangular wing into a swept, tapered wing typical of a transonic aircraft. The optimizer converges to the same wing shape when starting from a different initial design. Additionally, we use a separation constraint at a low-speed, high-lift condition to improve the off-design performance of the optimized wing. The separation constraint results in a substantially different wing design with better low-speed performance and only a slight decrease in cruise performance.},

 abstract = {Airfoil shape design is one of the most fundamental elements in aircraft design. Existing airfoil design tools require at least a few minutes to analyze a new shape and hours to perform shape optimization. To drastically reduce the computational time of both analysis and design optimization, we use machine learning to create a model of a wide range of possible airfoils at a range of flight conditions, making it possible to perform airfoil design optimization in a few seconds. The machine learning consists of gradient-enhanced artificial neural networks where the gradient information is phased in gradually. This new gradient-enhanced artificial neural network approach is trained to model the aerodynamic force coefficients of airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes. The aerodynamics is modeled with Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The proposed approach outperforms an existing airfoil model that uses a mixture of experts technique combined with a gradient-based Kriging surrogate model. The approach yields to similar airfoil shape optimization solutions than high-fidelity CFD optimization solutions with a difference of 0.01 count and 0.12 count for C d in subsonic and transonic regimes, respectively. Airfoil optimization problems are solved in a few seconds (instead of hours using CFD-based optimization), making the design process much more interactive, as demonstrated in the Webfoil airfoil design optimization tool.},

This article surveys the scholarly and business literature on fixed-wing aircraft propelled in whole or in part by electricity. This includes all-electric, hybrid electric, and turboelectric architectures. We introduce a classification of electric aircraft, technology factors, and performance parameters. Next, we present an overview of electrical components and electric propulsion architectures. We survey existing commercial products, prototypes, demonstrators, and conceptual studies, and develop a list of potential benefits and disadvantages of electric propulsion with estimates of potential benefit. We present an introduction to power electronics, electric machines, and batteries for aircraft designers, and explore the emerging problem of aircraft thermal management. We review modeling, simulation, and multidisciplinary optimization capabilities, and identify current shortcomings. We conclude that the electric aircraft design problem introduces new coupling between previously distinct disciplines, such as aerodynamics and propulsion, which may only become apparent with high-fidelity, physics-based analysis. High-fidelity multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization of electric aircraft, including safety and economic analysis, remains an open challenge.},

However, no known aerodynamic optimization framework can handle spatial integration constraints derived directly from three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. A general geometric constraint formulation based on triangulated 3-D geometry is proposed. The constraint consists of two metrics: the length of the intersection curve(s) between any two objects, and the Kreisselmeier--Steinhauser function aggregated minimum distance. The proposed implementation of the intersection and distance computations is fast and analytically differentiable with respect to geometric design variables, making it suitable for efficient gradient-based optimization. The constraint formulation is validated using three Reynoldsaveraged Navier--Stokes-based aerodynamic shape optimization problems: a 2-D fairing design problem, a 3-D fairing design problem, and the design of an aeroshell to surround a human avatar. It is shown that this approach is robust and efficient, enabling the aerodynamic optimization of bodies containing objects with arbitrary shapes.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen has been identified as a potential fuel for air transportation without carbon emissions. Hydrogen contains much higher energy per unit mass than any conceivable rechargeable battery, potentially making longer-range missions possible than pure electric configurations. However, hydrogen's low volumetric energy density presents practical challenges. Hydrogen must either be kept under deep cryogenic conditions or compressed under very high pressure. Either solution is likely to require adding significant drag and tank weight to the airplane. This is a packing optimization problem subject to aerostructural physics, and we can employ multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to provide insight into optimal wing design for novel hydrogen aircraft concepts. In this paper, we extend prior work on wing packing optimization subject to aerodynamics only, and now incorporate structural analysis and structure geometry into the problem. We optimize the range of a hydrogen-electric aircraft with hydrogen fuel storage located inside the wing outer mold line. The geometry of the hydrogen storage tanks influences the shape of the wing as well as the weight and volumetric capacity of the tank. While the effect of hydrogen storage on other aircraft concepts cannot be generalized from this study, the optimization methods we use are promising for performing relevant aircraft design trade studies. The optimizer finds the correct tradeoff between weight, drag, and fuel storage for the mission, subject to spatial integration feasibility. In our test scenario, we find that the optimal aerostructural design involves substantial wing root thickening.},

In this context, suitable tools have to be developed for solving aerodynamic shape optimisation problems, and the adjoint approach---which allows fast and accurate evaluations of the gradients with respect to the design parameters---is proved to be very efficient to eliminate the shock on aircraft wing in transonic flow. However, few applications were presented so far considering other design problems involving 3D viscous flows. This paper describes how the adjoint approach can also help the designer to efficiently reduce the flow separation onset at wing--fuselage intersection and to optimise the slat and flap positions of a 3D high-lift configuration. On all these cases, the optimisations were successfully performed within a limited number of flow evaluations, emphasising the benefit of the adjoint approach in aircraft shape design.},

@article{Brooks2018a,
 abstract = {Since its introduction the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) has served as a useful aerodynamic benchmark for drag prediction and optimization of various CFD codes. The model was originally conceived as a purely aerodynamic benchmark and as such the geometry of the wing was designed to take the shape of the deflected wing at a 1.0 g flight condition. There has been growing interest in extending this model to aeroelastic studies as well. However, due to its predefined deflection, the model as is isn't suitable for aeroelastic analysis and design. To address this we define an undeflected Common Research Model (uCRM) which includes the outer mold line (OML) geometry of the undeflected wing and the corresponding internal wing box structure, with the goal of achieving the flying shape of the CRM under nominal flight conditions. The topology of the wing box is designed to be similar to that of a Boeing 777. The jig shape was arrived at through an inverse design procedure where the objective was to minimize the difference between the 1.0 g aerostructurally deflected shape and the CRM. Since the original CRM has an aspect ratio of 9 we refer to this model as the uCRM-9. Since modern transport aircraft are trending toward higher aspect ratio wing designs in an attempt to reduce induced drag, and therefore fuel burn, it was desired to have an additional higher aspect ratio variant of this model, to assess the design potential of new future technologies with. This variant, uCRM-13.5, has a larger aspect ratio of 13.5 and is defined through an aerostructural optimization of the uCRM-9 with considerations for buffet. The goal for both of these models is to define a useful benchmark for aeroelastic wing analysis and design optimization studies.},

 abstract = {The adoption of conventional `` black metal'' composites in aircraft structures has lead to an improvement in performance over previous metallic designs. With the maturation of automated fiber placement, the design of unconventional composites featuring spatially varying tow orientations has become possible, but it is not yet clear how to utilize this new design freedom optimally. Wing design optimization studies are performed for three different material technologies: aluminum alloy, conventional carbon-fiber-reinforced composite, and tow-steered carbonfiber-reinforced composite. To explore the design trades of these materials, Pareto fronts for the competing objectives of fuel burn and structural weight are generated through gradient-based optimization. These two objectives serve as surrogates for the direct operating cost and acquisition cost of the aircraft, respectively. All optimized wings took advantage of some amount of passive load alleviation at the high-lift maneuver condition. Although the performance increase of tow-steered composite wings was not as dramatic as the performance increase of conventional composite relative to aluminum, the improvement was still significant. This work provides a methodology that can be used to explore tradeoffs in tow-steered wing designs and could be extended to other structural technologies.},

The methodology can be applied to assess the efficiency of a given approach, where efficiency is defined in terms of accuracy per unit cost measured in central processing unit time.

The benchmark cases to which the procedure is applied are two-dimensional turbulent flows modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations on three families of NACA 0012 grids with three sets of operating conditions. Performance statistics are presented in a variety of ways that show the relationships between central processing unit time, grid spacing, and accuracy in ways that are informative for both flow solver users and developers.},

The new continuation methods, described as monolithic homotopy continuation, differ from the classical predictor--corrector algorithm in that the predictor and corrector phases are replaced with a single phase which includes both a predictor and corrector component. Conditional convergence and stability are proved analytically. Using a Laplacian-like operator to construct the homotopy, the new algorithm is shown to be more efficient than the predictor--corrector homotopy continuation algorithm as well as an implementation of the widely-used pseudo-transient continuation algorithm for some inviscid and turbulent, subsonic and transonic external aerodynamic flows over the ONERA M6 wing and the NACA 0012 airfoil using a parallel implicit Newton--Krylov finite-difference flow solver.},

 abstract = {Abstract In this article, the structural composite design process is presented. It is shown that it is an extremely complicated task conducted nowadays with computers and numerical tools. It involves several disciplines, including computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), in an iterative process where optimization plays a very important role. The CAE of composite structures is described, and several ways to parameterize the laminates are explained. These parameterizations form the basis for the introduction of formulations for the structural composite optimal design, which is the main topic addressed here. Several optimization approaches have been proposed over the past years, but a global solution is not yet available. The ultimate solution procedure should address the problem at the CAD-CAE-CAM levels simultaneously, in order to provide light and safe designs that are ready to manufacture. Since the aeronautics industry has driven the innovation in structural composite design, most of the concepts described here are based on the developments carried out for large composite aircrafts.},

 abstract = {In implicit upwind methods for the solution of linearized Euler equations, one of the key issues is to balance large time steps, leading to a fast convergence behavior, and small time steps, needed to sufficiently resolve relevant flow features. A time step is determined by choosing a Courant--Friedrichs--Levy (CFL) number in every iteration. A novel CFL evolution strategy is introduced and compared with two existing strategies. Numerical experiments using the adaptive multiscale finite volume solver QUADFLOW demonstrate that all three CFL evolution strategies have their advantages and disadvantages. A fourth strategy aiming at reducing the residual as much as possible in every time step is also examined. Using automatic differentiation, a sensitivity analysis investigating the influence of the CFL number on the residual is carried out confirming that, today, CFL control is still a difficult and open problem.

 abstract = { Modem aerospace vehicle design requires the interac tion of multiple disciplines, traditionally processed in a sequential order. Multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), a formal methodology for the integration of these disci plines, is evolving toward methods capable of replacing the traditional sequential methodology of aerospace vehi cle design by concurrent algorithms, with both an overall gain in product performance and a decrease in design time. A parallel MDO paradigm using variable-complexity modeling and multipoint response surface approxima tions is presented here for the particular instance of the design of a high-speed civil transport (HSCT). This para digm interleaves the disciplines at one level of complexity and processes them hierarchically at another level of complexity, achieving parallelism within disciplines rather than across disciplines. A master-slave paradigm manages a coarse-grained parallelism of the analysis and optimization codes required by the disciplines showing reasonable speedups and efficiencies on an Intel Paragon. },

Krylov-Schwarz iterative methods are well suited for the parallel implicit solution of multidimensional systems of boundary value problems that arise in CFD. They provide good data locality so that even a high-latency workstation network can be employed as a parallel machine. We call the combination of these two methods Newton-Krylov-Schwarz and report numerical experiments on some algorithmic and implementation aspects: the use of mixed discretization schemes in the (implicitly defined) Jacobian and its preconditioner, the selection of the differencing parameter in the formation of the action of the Jacobian, the use of a coarse grid in additive Schwarz preconditioning, and workstation network implementation. Three model problems are considered: a convection-diffusion problem, the full potential equation, and the Euler equations.},

The specific features of the black-box-type objective function make the problem suitable for the application of DIRECT-type algorithms. The objective function is given by numerical iterative procedures, which could lead to inaccurate derivative calculations. In addition, the presence of local minima cannot be excluded a priori. The algorithms proposed (namely DIRMIN and DIRMIN-2) are hybridizations of the classic DIRECT algorithm, with deterministic derivative-free local searches. The algorithms' performances are first assessed on a set of test problems, and then applied to the ship optimization application. The numerical results show that the local hybridization of the DIRECT algorithm has beneficial effects on the overall computational cost and on the efficiency of the simulation-based optimization procedure.},

@article{Cao2017,
 abstract = {{A major challenge in structural health monitoring (SHM) is to accurately identify both the location and severity of damage using the dynamic response information acquired. While in theory the vibration-based and impedance-based methods may facilitate damage identification with the assistance of a credible baseline finite element model, the response information is generally limited, and the measurements may be heterogeneous, making an inverse analysis using sensitivity matrix difficult. Aiming at fundamental advancement, in this research we cast the damage identification problem into an optimization problem where possible changes of finite element properties due to damage occurrence are treated as unknowns. We employ the multiple damage location assurance criterion (MDLAC), which characterizes the relation between measurements and predictions (under sampled elemental property changes), as the vector-form objective function. We then develop an enhanced, multi-objective version of the dividing rectangles (DIRECT) approach to solve the optimization problem. The underlying idea of the multi-objective DIRECT approach is to branch and bound the unknown parametric space to converge to a set of optimal solutions. A new sampling scheme is established, which significantly increases the efficiency in minimizing the error between measurements and predictions. The enhanced DIRECT algorithm is particularly suited to solving for unknowns that are sparse, as in practical situations structural damage affects only a small region. A number of test cases using vibration response information are executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.}},

differential equations by using an iterative process to reduce a
residual quantity. Straightforward differentiation of these
programs yields an iterative recurrence that involves both the
derivative of the residual, and the derivative of the original
process. For a certain class of these problems, the derivative
recurrence can be {\em simplified\/} to avoid computing the
derivative of the original process. A program implementing a
simplified recurrence should run faster than its fully
differentiated counterpart, since it avoids the redundant
computation. In this paper we demonstrate a method for using
automatic differentiation tools to facilitate the production of
simplified derivative recurrence programs. We illustrate our
technique by constructing and validating a simplified derivative
version of the OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics program
using the ADIFOR automatic differentiation tool.},

The accuracy of the MQ method is dependent on a user defined parameter R2, and most practitioners select R2 based upon the number of data points and the locations of the (xi, yi) in the plane. We observe that the optimal value of R2 is a strong function of the zi, and that it is essentially independent of both the number and the locationsof the (xi, yi) points. Contrary to some opinions, we observe that the MQ method can effectively interpolate to ``track data'', that is, data sampled densely along tracks in the plane. Together with several other observations, we present an algorithm that generally yields an effective value for R2.},

 abstract = {ATE functional aim is to modify the wing TE shape at high speed in order to obtain an improvement in lift over drag (LoD) ratio in the whole flight envelope, virtually obtaining a wing working always at its actual LoD optimum level. This allows to compensate the weight reduction following the fuel burning and to increase climb and descent A/C performance levels. Initial morphed shapes specification has been obtained by a multidisciplinary optimization process matching the aerodynamic performances and structural loads on wing with a defined level of structural strain for an acceptable duration of skin material life cycle. The so obtained different wing seamless shapes have been further parametrically investigated from aerodynamic point of view so to obtain the most profitable device span and chord extension. Based on these requirements, a full-scale ATE functional concept demonstrator has been designed, sized, and realized, based on reference wing geometry of a 130 Pax jet engines regional A/C with a range of 3000 nautical miles, cruise Mach 0.75, and flight level 35,000 ft. Reference wing aerodynamic studies show the best ATE performances in a relatively high CL range (above 0.5) and for Mach below 0.6. Additional exploitation of ATE has been performed on a light business jet, designed to carry 4 passengers at a speed of Mach 0.65, or fly 1200 nm with 2 passengers. CL range of this A/C is relatively small (below 0.6). In this wing working range, the ATE application seems not to be effective.},

@article{Ceze2015a,
 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of finding a stationary point of a nonlinear dynamical system whose state variables are under inequality constraints. Systems of this type often arise from the discretization of PDEs that model physical phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics) in which the state variables are under realizability constraints (e.g., positive pressure and density). We start from the popular pseudo-transient continuation method and augment it with nonlinear inequality constraints. The constraint handling technique does not help in situations where no steady-state solution exists, for example, because of an under-resolved discretization of PDEs. However, an often overlooked situation is one in which the steady-state solution exists but cannot be reached by the solver, which typically fails because of the violation of constraints, that is, a non-physical state error during state iterations. This is the shortcoming that we address by incorporating physical realizability constraints into the solution path from the initial condition to steady state. Although we focus on the DG method applied to fluid dynamics, our technique relies only on implicit time marching and hence can be extended to other spatial discretizations and other physics problems. We analyze the sensitivity of the method to a range of input parameters and present results for compressible turbulent flows that show that the constrained method is significantly more robust than a standard unconstrained method while on par in terms of cost.

 abstract = {For flexible hydrofoils, the natural flow-induced bending and twisting deformations are coupled if the center of lift is away from the elastic axis; this coupling may be influenced by viscous effects due to movement in the center of lift. The objective of this work is to investigate the role of flow-induced bend--twist coupling effects, as well as their dependence on the reduced velocity and solid-to-fluid added mass ratio. A secondary objective is to compare inviscid and viscous fluid--structure interaction (FSI) simulations of the natural flow-induced vibration responses of flexible cantilevered hydrofoils in water. The focus is on attached flow conditions in fully turbulent regimes at low angles of attack, where inviscid FSI method should be relatively accurate, and the foil response should be dominated by the foil's natural frequencies. The viscous FSI model is formulated by coupling a two-dimensional (2D) unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (URANS) model with a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) model representing the spanwise tip bending and twisting deformations. The results show that the flow-induced bend--twist coupling terms are important for accurate prediction of the natural vibration frequencies and damping characteristics, particularly for the twisting motion, and their relative importance grows when the relative velocity increases and the solid-to-fluid added mass ratio decreases.},

The system consists of two main parts: a neural network-based face detection arbitrator, and a search strategy based on an integer-handling DIRECT algorithm. By the architecture, the number of arbitrations is dramatically reduced, and human faces, if they are present in an image, are not restricted to predetermined resolutions and aspect ratios. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is efficient in terms of both speed and robustness.},

 abstract = {Technological advances in areas such as battery technology, autonomous control, and ride-hailing services, combined with the scale-free nature of electric motors, have sparked significant interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban air mobility. In this work, we use simplified models for the aerodynamics, propulsion, propeller--wing flow interaction, and flight mechanics to carry out gradient-based optimization studies for the takeoff-to-cruise trajectory of a tandem tilt-wing eVTOL aircraft. We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct. We also present results showing the impact of wing loading and available power on the optimized trajectories.},

 abstract = {The recent growth of interest in hybrid-electric and fully electric aircraft has led to a renewed focus on the design and optimization of propeller aircraft. Considering propeller--wing interaction provides the opportunity to design aircraft that take advantage of aerodynamic benefits through propulsion integration. In this paper, the cruise drag of a wing with an inboard-mounted tractor propeller is minimized using aerodynamic shape optimization. Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes computational fluid dynamics with an actuator-disk approach is used for the simulations, and a gradient-based algorithm is used for the optimization. Changing the rotation direction of the propeller and optimizing the twist and airfoil shapes of the wing impact the aerodynamic performance significantly. However, optimizing the wing while considering the propeller slipstream provides little additional benefit compared to optimizing it without considering the propeller slipstream (the difference is less than one drag count). The wings optimized without considering the propeller slipstream are naturally able to recover swirl almost as effectively as the wings optimized while considering the propeller slipstream, and the propeller-induced velocities for the cruise condition are not high enough to lead to significant airfoil-shape design changes.},

@article{Chen2019,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to control the discretization error in constrained aerodynamic shape optimization problems using meshes adapted via adjoint-based error estimates. The optimization constraints may involve outputs that are not directly targeted for optimization, and hence also not for error estimation and mesh adaptation. However, discretization errors in these outputs often indirectly affect the calculation of the objective function. The proposed method takes this effect into account, so that the mesh is adapted and itself optimized to predict both objective outputs and constraint outputs with appropriate accuracy. We use unstructured mesh optimization to maximize accuracy of the results for a given number of degrees of freedom. The error estimates drive a multifidelity optimization process, preventing over-optimization on a coarse mesh and over-refinement on an undesired design. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method on several airfoil shape optimization problems governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The framework is expected to be even more important for optimization problems with complex systems, dramatic design changes, or high-accuracy requirements.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider the challenge of maximizing an unknown function f for which evaluations are noisy and are acquired with high cost. An iterative procedure uses the previous measures to actively select the next estimation of f which is predicted to be the most useful. We focus on the case where the function can be evaluated in parallel with batches of fixed size and analyze the benefit compared to the purely sequential procedure in terms of cumulative regret. We introduce the Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound and Pure Exploration algorithm (GP-UCB-PE) which combines the UCB strategy and Pure Exploration in the same batch of evaluations along the parallel iterations. We prove theoretical upper bounds on the regret with batches of size K for this procedure which show the improvement of the order of {\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}K{\}}{\$}for fixed iteration cost over purely sequential versions. Moreover, the multiplicative constants involved have the property of being dimension-free. We also confirm empirically the efficiency of GP-UCB-PE on real and synthetic problems compared to state-of-the-art competitors.},

 abstract = {When analysing data from computationally expensive simulation codes or process measurements, surrogate modelling methods are firmly established as facilitators for design space exploration, sensitivity analysis, visualisation and optimisation. Kriging is a popular surrogate modelling technique for data based on deterministic computer experiments. There exist several types of Kriging, mostly differing in the type of regression function used. Recently a promising new variable selection technique was proposed to identify a regression function in the Kriging framework. In this paper this type of Kriging, i.e., blind Kriging, has been efficiently implemented in Matlab{\textregistered} and has been extended. The implementation is validated and tested on several examples to illustrate the strength and weaknesses of this new, promising modelling technique. It is shown that the performance of blind Kriging is as good as, or better than ordinary Kriging. Though, blind Kriging comes at double the computational cost with respect to ordinary Kriging.},

 abstract = {Radial basis function interpolation is often employed in mesh deformation algorithms for unstructured meshes, for example in fluid--structure interaction or design optimization problems. This is known to be a robust methodology that results in high quality deformed meshes. The applicability of this method to large problems is currently hampered by its prohibitive computational cost, however, which is caused by the need to solve a dense system of equations. The computation time grows as  O(Nb3) if a direct solver is employed for the solution (where Nb denotes the number of boundary nodes in the mesh), while alternative iterative solvers often suffer from an unfavorable convergence behavior. In this paper, we present the inverse fast multipole method as a novel fast approximate direct solver with a computational cost scaling as  O(Nb). The linear complexity is achieved by transforming the dense system into an extended sparse system, along with the compression of certain matrix blocks into low-rank factorizations. The solver is inexact, although the error can be controlled and made as small as needed; a low accuracy solver can hence be used as an efficient preconditioner in an iterative scheme. Numerical benchmarks are presented, demonstrating that the proposed approach enhances the computational efficiency of mesh deformation algorithms based on radial basis function interpolation significantly, without jeopardizing their robustness and quality.},

 abstract = {The conceptual design of aircraft often entails a large number of nonlinear constraints that result in a nonconvex feasible design space and multiple local optima. The design of the high-speed civil transport (HSCT) is used as an example of a highly complex conceptual design with 26 design variables and 68 constraints. This paper compares three global optimization techniques on the HSCT problem and two test problems containing thousands of local optima and noise: multistart local optimizations using either sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as implemented in the design optimization tools (DOT) program or Snyman's dynamic search method, and a modified form of Jones' DIRECT global optimization algorithm. SQP is a local optimizer, while Snyman's algorithm is capable of moving through shallow local minima. The modified DIRECT algorithm is a global search method based on Lipschitzian optimization that locates small promising regions of design space and then uses a local optimizer to converge to the optimum. DOT and the dynamic search algorithms proved to be superior for finding a single optimum masked by noise of trigonometric form. The modified DIRECT algorithm was found to be better for locating the global optimum of functions with many widely separated true local optima.},

The implementation and the performance of a Newton--Krylov matrix-free (MF) method is presented and compared with the matrix based (MB) counterpart. Moreover two solution strategies, developed in order to increase the solver efficiency, are discussed and experimented. Numerical results of some test cases proposed within the EU ADIGMA (Adaptive Higher-Order Variational Methods for Aerodynamic Applications in Industry) project demonstrate the capabilities of the method.},

@article{CSoutis2005a,
 abstract = {Fibrous composites have found applications in aircraft from the first flight of the Wright Brothers' Flyer 1, in North Carolina on December 17, 1903, to the plethora of uses now enjoyed by them on both military and civil aircrafts, in addition to more exotic applications on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), space launchers and satellites. Their growing use has risen from their high specific strength and stiffness, when compared to the more conventional materials, and the ability to shape and tailor their structure to produce more aerodynamically efficient structural configurations. In this paper, a review of recent advances using composites in modern aircraft construction is presented and it is argued that fibre reinforced polymers, especially carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) can and will in the future contribute more than 50% of the structural mass of an aircraft. However, affordability is the key to survival in aerospace manufacturing, whether civil or military, and therefore effort should be devoted to analysis and computational simulation of the manufacturing and assembly process as well as the simulation of the performance of the structure, since they are intimately connected.},

 abstract = {The Mission-Adaptive Wing (MAW) employs composite materials and uses a digital fly-by-wire flight control system to change wing contour to maintain peak aerodynamic efficiency over a large flight envelope. Future aircraft will require large subsonic and supersonic lift-to-drag ratios for maximum cruise ranges at high and low altitudes. At the same time, they will require the ability to pull high lift coefficients for maneuvers. The Mission-Adaptive Wing provides these Features by deflecting flexible wing surfaces to achieve the wing camber and smooth continuous upper surface contour required for peak aerodynamic performance. The MAW program completed manual control flight testing in November 1986 and started automatic control flight testing in the summer of 1987. During the manual phase of flight testing, surfaces were set in discrete positions. Resulting data confirmed the aerodynamic potential to achieve all program goals. The automatic control phase will test four modes designed to increase range, maneuverability, and operational flexibility without affecting pilot workload.},

@article{Destarac2018a,
 abstract = { The Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee of AIAA launched an optimization discussion group, the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group, in 2013. One of the four benchmark test cases is based on the NACA 0012 airfoil and solutions of the Euler equations with prescribed objective function and geometric constaints. Volunteer participants were invited by ONERA--The French Aerospace Lab to submit their optimized shapes for uniform pressure drag assessment through grid convergence. The assessment required three phases. Initial investigations with a simple protocol proved insufficient and raised some questions. This led to further investigations, which showed that, for most optimized airfoils, there exists a lower drag branch and a higher drag branch in the drag (Mach number) diagram. Hysteresis was observed when performing a downward Mach number sweep and an upward Mach number sweep. For several airfoils, the design Mach number falls within the overlap range of the two branches, which indicates that two solutions may exist for the same airfoil. Two kinds of supersonic flow structure can be distinguished. One kind produces a lower drag branch and the other a higher drag branch. The jump from one branch to the other involves nonsymmetrical converged solutions. These further investigations required a final assessment, where a protocol was instituted to ensure that the lower drag branch was captured by taking advantage of the hysteresis. However, nonuniqueness may confound an optimization algorithm because the same set of design variables can give two different objective function values. },

To this purpose, an improved Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT) algorithm is proposed to substitute for the commonly used grid search method. The proposed global optimization algorithm can provide initial estimates for local optimization algorithms such as Newton and Simplex. Based on classical DIRECT algorithm, the improved version, called Lipschitz constant assisted DIRECT (L-DIRECT) Algorithm, eliminates hopeless areas, suspends unlikely areas, and concentrates on more promising areas in search space, finding the range of attraction (ROA) with lower SNR threshold or less computational burden for local optimization algorithms.

 abstract = {Constrained global optimization problems can be tackled by using exact penalty approaches. In a preceding paper, we proposed an exact penalty algorithm for constrained problems which combines an unconstrained global minimization technique for minimizing a non-differentiable exact penalty function for given values of the penalty parameter, and an automatic updating of the penalty parameter that occurs only a finite number of times. However, in the updating of the penalty parameter, the method requires the evaluation of the derivatives of the problem functions. In this work, we show that an efficient updating can be implemented also without using the problem derivatives, in this way making the approach suitable for globally solving constrained problems where the derivatives are not available. In the algorithm, any efficient derivative-free unconstrained global minimization technique can be used. In particular, we adopt an improved version of the DIRECT algorithm. In addition, to improve the performances, the approach is enriched by resorting to derivative-free local searches, in a multistart framework. In this context, we prove that, under suitable assumptions, for every global minimum point there exists a neighborhood of attraction for the local search. An extensive numerical experience is reported.},

 abstract = {In the field of global optimization, many efforts have been devoted to globally solving bound constrained optimization problems without using derivatives. In this paper we consider global optimization problems where both bound and general nonlinear constraints are present. To solve this problem we propose the combined use of a DIRECT-type algorithm with a derivative-free local minimization of a nonsmooth exact penalty function. In particular, we define a new DIRECT-type strategy to explore the search space by explicitly taking into account the two-fold nature of the optimization problems, i.e. the global optimization of both the objective function and of a feasibility measure. We report an extensive experimentation on hard test problems to show viability of the approach.},

 abstract = {An interactive design and optimization framework for the development of multielement airfoils is presented. A zonal Euler/Boundary-layer flow solver is used as the underlying analysis method. The full Newton solution method of the solver permits effectively 'free" calculation of flowfield sen- sitivities to predefined airfoil element shape deformation modes, and also to rigid-body element translation and ro- tation modes. The sensitivity of any aerodynamic quantity of interest, including drag, to all the geometric parameters is thus obtained. Single-point and multi-point optimiza- tion and least-squares inverse techniques are constructed with the sensitivity information. Aerodynamic and geomet- ric constraints are also readily incorporated. The method's ability to economically incorporate many design variables into interactively-specified design and/or optimization prob lems makes it particularly effective in multielement airfoil development. Applications are presented for: 1) Multi-point optimiza- tion of a novel two-element transonic cruise airfoil with a thickness constraint, and 2) CLmax optimization of a four- element landing configuration airfoil.},

@article{Elishakoff1994a,
 abstract = {In many cases precise probabilistic data are not available on uncertainty in loads, but the magnitude of the uncertainty can be bound. This paper proposes a design approach for structural optimization with uncertain but bounded loads. The problem of identifying critical loads is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem in itself (called anti-optimization), so that the design problem is formulated as a two-level optimization. For linear structural analysis it is shown that the antioptimization part is limited to consideration of the vertices of the load-uncertainty domain. An example of a ten-bar truss is used to demonstrate that we cannot replace the anti-optimization process by considering the largest possible loads.},

@article{FernandezGodino2021a,
 abstract = {Failure in brittle materials under dynamic loading conditions is a result of the propagation and coalescence of microcracks. Simulating this discrete crack evolution at the continuum level is computationally expensive or, in some cases, intractable, resulting in the need to make broad assumptions or neglect key physics. We have developed an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current inability to represent meso-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach leverages damage and stress data from a computationally expensive high-fidelity model that explicitly resolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator. Once trained, the machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of crack length statistics, which then informs a continuum-scale constitutive model. This results in a significant speed-up of the workflow by four orders of magnitude. Both the machine learning emulator and the continuum-scale model are validated against the high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively, showing excellent agreement. There are two key findings. The first is that we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing that the machine learning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the maximum stress components to capture the necessary physics. Another compelling finding is that the emulator can be trained in one experimental setting and transferred successfully to predict behavior in a different setting.},

 abstract = {We present a p-multigrid solution algorithm for a high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. The algorithm employs an element line Jacobi smoother in which lines of elements are formed using coupling based on a p=0 discretization of the scalar convection--diffusion equation. Fourier analysis of the two-level p-multigrid algorithm for convection--diffusion shows that element line Jacobi presents a significant improvement over element Jacobi especially for high Reynolds number flows and stretched grids. Results from inviscid and viscous test cases demonstrate optimal hp+1 order of accuracy as well as p-independent multigrid convergence rates, at least up to p=3. In addition, for the smooth problems considered, p-refinement outperforms h-refinement in terms of the time required to reach a desired high accuracy level.},

Numerical tests on a wide range of test problems are very encouraging and the new algorithm compares favourably with LANCELOT and an implementation of Sl1QP.},

@article{Gagnon2015a,
 abstract = {An intuitive shape parameterization and control technique suitable for high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. It relies on the principles of free-form and axial deformation, enabling thorough exploration of the design space while keeping the number of design variables manageable. Surface sensitivities to the design variables are readily available; their inclusion in a highly efficient and robust adjoint-based optimization methodology involving linearly elastic volume mesh deformation and a Newton--Krylov solver for the Euler equations is described. The flexibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the exploratory shape optimization of a three-pronged feathered winglet, leading to a span efficiency of 1.19 under a height-to-span ratio constraint of 0.1, and an optimization of a regional jet wing at transonic speed where a winglet is allowed to develop starting from a planar wingtip extension, leading to an 18.8\% reduction in drag.},

@article{Giannelis2017a,
 abstract = {Within a narrow band of flight conditions in the transonic regime, interactions between shock-waves and intermittently separated shear layers result in large amplitude, self-sustained shock oscillations. This phenomenon, known as transonic shock buffet, limits the flight envelope and is detrimental to both platform handling quality and structural integrity. The severity of this instability has incited a plethora of research to ascertain an underlying physical mechanism, and yet, with over six decades of investigation, aspects of this complex phenomenon remain inexplicable. To promote continual progress in the understanding of transonic shock buffet, this review presents a consolidation of recent investigations in the field. The paper begins with a conspectus of the seminal literature on shock-induced separation and modes of shock oscillation. The currently prevailing theories for the governing physics of transonic shock buffet are then detailed. This is followed by an overview of computational studies exploring the phenomenon, where the results of simulation are shown to be highly sensitive to the specific numerical methods employed. Wind tunnel investigations on two-dimensional aerofoils at shock buffet conditions are then outlined and the importance of these experiments for the development of physical models stressed. Research considering dynamic structural interactions in the presence of shock buffet is also highlighted, with a particular emphasis on the emergence of a frequency synchronisation phenomenon. An overview of three-dimensional buffet is provided next, where investigations suggest the governing mechanism may differ significantly from that of two-dimensional sections. Subsequently, a number of buffet suppression technologies are described and their efficacy in mitigating shock oscillations is assessed. To conclude, recommendations for the direction of future research efforts are given.},

 abstract = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods
have proved highly effective for solving constrained
optimization problems with smooth nonlinear
functions in the ob jective and constraints. Here we
consider problems with general inequality
constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that
first derivatives are available and that the
constraint gradients are sparse. We discuss an SQP
algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian
merit function and makes explicit provision for
infeasibility in the original problem and the QP
subproblems. SNOPT is a particular implementation
that makes use of a semidefinite QP solver. It is
based on a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation
to the Hessian of the Lagrangian and uses a
reduced-Hessian algorithm (SQOPT) for solving the QP
subproblems. It is designed for problems with many
thousands of constraints and variables but a
moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to
2000). An important application is to tra jectory
optimization in the aerospace industry. Numerical
results are given for most problems in the CUTE and
COPS test collections (about 900 examples).},

@misc{Gill2006a,
 abstract = {SNOPT is a general-purpose system for constrained optimization. It minimizes a linear or nonlinear function subject to bounds on the variables and sparse linear or nonlinear constraints. It is suitable for large-scale linear and quadratic programming and for linearly constrained optimization, as well as for general nonlinear programs. SNOPT finds solutions that are locally optimal, and ideally any nonlinear functions should be smooth and users should provide gradients. It is often more widely useful. For example, local optima are often global solutions, and discontinuities in the function gradients can often be tolerated if they are not too close to an optimum. Unknown gradients are estimated by finite differences. SNOPT uses a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Search directions are obtained from QP subproblems that minimize a quadratic model of the Lagrangian function subject to linearized constraints. An augmented Lagrangian merit function is reduced along each search direction to ensure convergence from any starting point. On large problems, SNOPT is most efficient if only some of the variables enter nonlinearly, or there are relatively few degrees of freedom at a solution (i.e., many constraints are active). SNOPT requires relatively few evaluations of the problem functions. Hence it is especially effective if the objective or constraint functions (and their gradients) are expensive to evaluate. The source code is re-entrant and suitable for any machine with a Fortran compiler (or the f2c translator and a C compiler). SNOPT may be called from a driver program in Fortran, C, or Matlab. It can also be used as a stand-alone package, reading data in the MPS format used by commercial mathematical programming systems.},

 abstract = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodel-based exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}is given when q{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q{\thinspace}∈ [1,10]).},

 abstract = { A variety of combinatorial problems (e.g., in capital budgeting, scheduling, allocation) can be expressed as a linear integer programming problem. However, the standard devices for doing this often produce an inordinate number of variables and constraints, putting the problem beyond the practical reach of available integer programming methods. This paper presents new formulation techniques for capturing the essential nonlinearities of the problem of interest, while producing a significantly smaller problem size than the standard techniques. },

@article{Goel2007a,
 abstract = {The custom in surrogate-based modeling of complex engineering problems is to fit one or more surrogate models and select the one surrogate model that performs best. In this paper, we extend the utility of an ensemble of surrogates to (1) identify regions of possible high errors at locations where predictions of surrogates widely differ, and (2) provide a more robust approximation approach. We explore the possibility of using the best surrogate or a weighted average surrogate model instead of individual surrogate models. The weights associated with each surrogate model are determined based on the errors in surrogates. We demonstrate the advantages of an ensemble of surrogates using analytical problems and one engineering problem. We show that for a single problem the choice of test surrogate can depend on the design of experiments.},

 abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is concerned with solving design problems involving coupled numerical models of complex engineering systems. While various MDO software frameworks exist, none of them take full advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms to solve coupled models efficiently. Furthermore, there is a need to facilitate the computation of the derivatives of these coupled models for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms to enable design with respect to large numbers of variables. In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework's efficiency by benchmarking scalable test problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.},

 abstract = {Boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) promises increased aircraft efficiency, but excessive inlet distortion must be avoided to prevent fans that are too heavy or structurally infeasible. We propose a new approach to study the effect of distortion on BLI propulsors via an aeropropulsive design optimization with a constraint on inlet distortion using highly efficient gradient-based methods with analytic derivatives. The fully coupled aeropropulsive model includes a three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes aerodynamic analysis of the flow and a thermodynamic cycle model of the propulsor fan. We minimize the shaft power required at cruise for the aft BLI thruster by varying the propulsor size and the shape of the propulsor nacelle and aft fuselage. Optimizations are performed with and without the inlet distortion constraint for different aft-propulsor sizes to study the impact of the constraint on overall BLI performance. The results show that imposing a distortion constraint increased the required propulsor shaft power by up to 1.2% relative to the unconstrained case, and that smaller propulsors suffer lower performance degradation than larger ones. The results underline the importance of using a fully coupled aeropropulsive model to predict BLI performance and demonstrate the power of aeropropulsive optimization in the design of BLI configurations.},

Different constraints are imposed to improve propeller design. Several advancements in the method are shown, including the option for quadratic skew, user specified skew distribution, and a constraint limiting the minimum pressure in wetted regions of the blade. Results for a series of fully wetted runs demonstrate the effectiveness of the constraint on minimum pressure in preventing the onset of bubble or mid-chord cavitation. A comparison of a design in uniform inflow with a design in non-axisymmetric inflow indicates that a propeller designed by the present method in non-axisymmetric inflow has more favorable cavitating flow characteristics than a propeller design assuming uniform inflow. Results are also shown for a series of runs utilizing the cavity constraints. These results indicate that the present method can be used to improve on propeller designs by imposing constraints on the cavity area and cavity volume velocity harmonics, as well as by using a quadratic skew distribution.}},

if the scope of these design variables is clear and well understood, the vision of the structure behaviour is
multi-criteria and encompasses various fidelity levels. Its design requires several stages from the future project to
the detailed definition of structural parts using various analysis tools from different disciplines. These several
stages require adequate structural optimisation processes to offer the best response with the right level of detail to
answer questions being sought at each maturity level of the design. A review of methods and tools developed and

 abstract = {AIRBUS are using a wide variety of tools for structural sizing. Indeed, depending on the design stage, the focus is put on different levels of definition. In late design stages the detailed design is addressed up to the arrangement of composite plies and advanced numerical tools are used for virtual testing. In preliminary design stages the distribution of thicknesses is considered with engineer justification stress tools. In early design stages the design is concentrated on architecture, choice of materials, choice of profiles and requires a fast sizing procedure and less accuracy on detailed stress calculations. Each design stage requires a suited methodology and tool. For the rapid sizing needed at conceptual design stage, a prototype tool called RHAPSODY has recently been developed by AIRBUS with SAMTECH for such sizing studies. The approach was to degrade in an acceptable extent the preliminary sizing in order to speed-up the reactivity of the tool and focus on higher level parametric studies. Optimisation problem reductions and simplifications were made. Surrogate models from polynomial to Artificial Neural Networks were used. Library of profiles and materials were built and exploited. The optimisation process usually restricted to covers was extended to internal components with the target to address whole aircraft structure
optimisation. This sizing tool, when fully mature and coupled with a full CAD-CAE associative link enabling architecture
parameterisation should help AIRBUS to design the best airframe concepts in the quickest lead times.},

 abstract = {Structural sizing optimization at Airbus leans on different approaches depending on the needs. Two main solutions have been defined, mainly for questions of performance and deployment. A rapid solution (PRESTO) has been developed based on a pure discrete algorithm to perform parametric trade-off studies in early design stages. The structure optimization process has been simplified in such a way that it is as quick as possible. This is the right solution to be used by non-expert users in early overall aircraft studies. It exploits large databases and surrogate models in a Big Data mindset. A more advanced solution (ACO-AMO) has been developed to support later design stages and more detailed optimization. It uses a standard continuous optimization approach based on gradient information and state of the art mathematical programming algorithms. A second step allows performing a discrete ply-by-ply optimization for composite covers using an optimization heuristic (ant colony paradigm). This is the right technology to address advanced structure optimization and to be included in MDO processes. Both methods are under integration in a single platform (SOFIA) to provide adequate sizing optimization services for the relevant components (e.g. wing, fuselage) and design stages. A status will be made in this paper on the technologies used in the different tools, the applications performed and the current and future research and development axes especially in the effort to merge solutions or to integrate them in multidisciplinary processes.},

 abstract = {Implicit solution methods are important in applications modeled by PDEs with disparate temporal and spatial scales. Because such applications require high resolution with reasonable turnaround, parallelization is essential. The pseudo-transient matrix-free Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (?NKS) algorithmic framework is presented as a widely applicable answer. This article shows that for the classical problem of three-dimensional transonic Euler flow about an M6 wing, ?NKS can simultaneously deliver globalized, asymptotically rapid convergence through adaptive pseudo-transient continuation and Newton?s method; reasonable parallelizability for an implicit method through deferred synchronization and favorable communication-to-computation scaling in the Krylov linear solver; and high per processor performance through attention to distributed memory and cache locality, especially through the Schwarz preconditioner. Two discouraging features of ?NKS methods are their sensitivity to the coding of the underlying PDE discretization and the large number of parameters that must be selected to govern convergence. The authors therefore distill several recommendations from their experience and reading of the literature on various algorithmic components of ?NKS, and they describe a freely available MPI-based portable parallel software implementation of the solver employed here.},

 abstract = {The aim of this research is the identification of a unified bookkeeping and evaluation scheme for the integrated performance analysis of a boundary layer ingesting (BLI) concept in the conceptual design phase. A thorough review and classification of existing performance bookkeeping schemes suits as a basis for the derivation of a bookkeeping scheme suitable for the initial sizing as well as detailed design analysis during the conceptual phase of a BLI concept. Figures of merit for the concept performance assessment are evaluated with regard to the requirements of aircraft multidisciplinary conceptual design. Based on the survey, the most practical integral momentum conservation approach is deduced and its application to integrated conceptual sizing and a subsequent design analysis is evaluated. The proposed scheme is universally applicable to coupled airframe--propulsion aircraft concepts, compatible with standard aircraft and propulsion system sizing tools and, under certain assumptions, deployable for low- and high-fidelity evaluation methods. Finally, several figures of merit are selected to cover a range of design aspects in the BLI evaluation.},

@article{Haftka1989a,
 abstract = {Abstract The introduction of composite materials is having a profound effect on the design process. Because these materials permit the designer to tailor material properties to improve structural, aerodynamic and acoustic performance, they require a more integrated multidisciplinary design process. Because of the complexity of the design process numerical optimization methods are required. The present paper is focused on a major difficulty associated with the multidisciplinary design optimization process---its enormous computational cost. We consider two approaches for reducing this computational burden: (i)development of efficient methods for cross-sensitivity calculation using perturbation methods; and (ii) the use of approximate numerical optimization procedures. Our efforts are concentrated upon combined aerodynamic-structural optimization. Results are presented for the integrated design of a sailplane wing. The impact of our computational procedures on the computational costs of integrated designs is discussed.},

@article{Haftka1989b,
 abstract = {Optimization techniques are increasingly being used for performing nonlinear structural analysis. Under these circumstances the structural design problem can be viewed as a nested optimization problem. The present paper suggests that there are computational benefits to treating this nested problem as a large single optimization problem. That is, the response variables (such as displacements) and the structural parameters are all treated as design variables in a unified formulation which performs simultaneously the design and analysis. Three truss examples are used for the demonstration comparing two nested optimization procedures with two computational procedures for the simultaneous solution. The examples show that the simultaneous approach is competitive with the more traditional nested approach.},

@article{Hall2017a,
 abstract = {This paper presents a description of the physical principles of aerodynamic power savings from boundary layer ingestion propulsion and a quantitative evaluation of the boundary layer ingestion benefit for advanced civil aircraft. Control volume and one-dimensional analyses are used to illustrate two major features of boundary layer ingestion: reduction of jet mixing losses due to decreased jet kinetic energy from reduced velocity of flow entering the propulsor and, to a lesser extent, reduction of airframe wake mixing losses. Embedded boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems can also enable nacelles with reduced surface area and associated weight and drag, further decreasing the aircraft propulsive power requirement. The required propulsor flow power is shown to decrease with increases in both the amount of boundary layer ingested and the propulsor mass flow, and there is thus no unique way to compare boundary layer ingestion and non-boundary-layer-ingestion systems. Using the ideas presented, however, the benefit can be assessed for any given comparison. The analysis is applied to an advanced civil transport aircraft concept with 40\% of the fuselage boundary layer ingested, yielding a reduction in required propulsor mechanical power of 9\% relative to a non-boundary-layer-ingestion configuration with the same propulsors, in agreement with computational fluid dynamics calculations and wind tunnel experiments.},

 abstract = {We consider the following global optimization problems for a Lipschitz functionf implicitly defined on an interval [a, b]. Problem P{\textasciiacutex}: find a globally$\epsilon$-optimal value off and a corresponding point; Problem Q{\textacutedbl}: find a set of disjoint subintervals of [a, b] containing only points with a globally$\epsilon$-optimal value and the union of which contains all globally optimal points. A two-phase algorithm is proposed for Problem P{\textasciiacutex}. In phase I, this algorithm obtains rapidly a solution which is often globally$\epsilon$-optimal. Moreover, a sufficient condition onf for this to be the case is given. In phase II, the algorithm proves the$\epsilon$-optimality of the solution obtained in phase I or finds a sequence of points of increasing value containing one with a globally$\epsilon$-optimal value. The new algorithm is empirically compared (on twenty problems from the literature) with a best possible algorithm (for which the optimal value is assumed to be known), with a passive algorithm and with the algorithms of Evtushenko, Galperin, Shen and Zhu, Piyavskii, Timonov and Schoen. For small$\epsilon$, the new algorithm requires only a few percent more function evaluations than the best possible one.

 abstract = {Lipschitz optimization solves global optimization problems in which the objective function and constraint left-hand sides may be given by oracles (or explicitly) and have a bounded slope. The problems of finding an optimal solution, an $\epsilon$-optimal one, all optimal solutions, and a small volume enclosure of all optimal solutions within hyperrectangles (possibly containing only a-optimal points) are investigated. In the univariate case, necessary conditions for finite convergence are studied as well as bounds on the number of iterations and convergence of e-optimal algorithms. Methods of Piyayskii, Evtushenko, Timonov, Schoen, Galperin, Shen and Zhu, and Hansen, Jaumard and Lu are discussed and compared experimentally. The same is done in the multivariate case for the algorithms of Piyayskii; Mladineo; Jaumard, Herrmann and Ribault; Pinter; Galperin; Meewella and Mayne; Wood; Gourdin, Hansen and Jaumard.},

@techreport{Harris2005,
 abstract = {A new economic model, built upon operating expenses from 67 airlines as reported to the Department of Transportation (DOT) in 1999, has been developed. The model incorporates several expense-estimating equations that capture direct and indirect expenses of both passenger and cargo airlines. The variables and business factors included in the equations allow expenses to be calculated at the flight equipment (i.e., aircraft) reporting level. Total operating expenses for a given airline are then obtained by summation of all aircraft an entity operates followed by summation for all entities operated by the airline.

The model's accuracy is demonstrated by correlation with the DOT Form 41 data from which it was derived. The specific Form 41 accounts, for which expense equations were derived and correlation shown, are as follows:
For Total Aircraft Operating Expenses (direct expenses) Flight Crew
Fuel & Oil
Insurance
Rental
Other Flying Operations Airframe Maintenance Engine Maintenance Depreciation & Amortization
For All Other Operating Expenses (indirect expenses) Passenger Service
Landing Fees
Rest of All Other (Includes: Aircraft Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Advertising & Promotions,
General & Administration, Maintenance & Depreciation of Ground Equipment) Transport Related},

 abstract = {The adjoint method is an efficient approach for computing derivatives that allow gradient-based optimization to handle systems parameterized with a large number of design variables. Despite this advantage, implementing the adjoint method for a partial-differential-equation-based primal solver is a time-consuming task. To lower the barrier for adjoint implementations, an object-oriented framework (DAFoam) is proposed to rapidly implement the discrete adjoint method for any steady-state OpenFOAM primal solver by adding or modifying only a few hundred lines of source code. In this paper, the DAFoam framework is introduced and the proposed object-oriented adjoint development processis illustrated.Usingthisstrategy,the adjointmethodis implementedfor eightprimal solvers,five turbulence models, and one radiation model in OpenFOAM. Excellent adjoint speed and scalability, with up to 10 million cells and 1536 CPU cores, and an average error in the adjoint derivatives of less than 0.1% are achieved. Finally, the implemented adjoint solvers and models are integrated into a gradient-based optimization framework, and four distinct design optimizations (multipoint aerodynamic optimization of a low-speed unmanned-aerial-vehicle wing, aerodynamic optimization of a transonic aircraft configuration, aerothermal optimization of a turbine internal cooling passage, and aerostructural optimization of a compressor rotor) are shown. DAFoam is available under an open-source license and is a powerful tool for the high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization of engineering systems, such as aircraft, ground vehicles, marine vessels, and turbomachinery.},

 abstract = {Flutter and limit cycle oscillation (LCO) are important phenomena that need to be considered in aircraft design. Previous harmonic-balance-based flutter and LCO prediction methods either have low linear convergence rates or require expensive Newton steps to achieve quadratic convergence. In this paper, we propose a preconditioned, Jacobian-free, coupled Newton--Krylov (CNK) method for the time-spectral aeroelastic equations. By solving the coupled system directly, the method reduces the computational cost of each Newton step, making quadratic convergence affordable. The proposed Jacobian-free method is easier to implement and requires less memory relative to previous methods. We demonstrate the capability of the CNK solver by verifying the results against a time-accurate solver and by comparing them to other harmonic-balance-based results reported in the literature. We observe that the proposed method is more efficient than the time-accurate method in LCO response simulations. And the LCO velocities and frequencies predicted by the proposed method and the time-accurate method are within 1\% of relative difference when the same mesh is used. This method can be potentially used in aircraft design.},

@article{Hegseth2020a,
 abstract = {A linearized aero-hydro-servo-elastic floating wind turbine model is presented and used to perform integrated design optimization of the platform, tower, mooring system, and blade-pitch controller for a 10 MW spar floating wind turbine. Optimal design solutions are found using gradient-based optimization with analytic derivatives, considering both fatigue and extreme response constraints, where the objective function is a weighted combination of system cost and power quality. Optimization results show that local minima exist both in the soft-stiff and stiff-stiff range for the first tower bending mode and that a stiff-stiff tower design is needed to reach a solution that satisfies the fatigue constraints. The optimized platform has a relatively small diameter in the wave zone to limit the wave loads on the structure and an hourglass shape far below the waterline. The shape increases the restoring moment and natural frequency in pitch, which leads to improved behaviour in the low-frequency range. The importance of integrated optimization is shown in the solutions for the tower and blade-pitch control system, which are clearly affected by the simultaneous design of the platform. State-of-the-art nonlinear time-domain analyses show that the linearized model is conservative in general, but reasonably accurate in capturing trends, suggesting that the presented methodology is suitable for preliminary integrated design calculations.},

@article{Hegseth2020b,
 abstract = {One of the challenges related to the design of floating wind turbines (FWTs) is the strong interactions between the controller and the support structure, which may result in an unstable system. Several control strategies have been proposed to improve the dynamic behaviour, all of which result in trade-offs between structural loads, rotor speed variation, and blade pitch actuator use, which makes controller design a challenging task. Due to the interactions, simultaneous design of the controller and support structure should be performed to properly identify and compare different solutions. In the present work, integrated design optimization of the blade-pitch controller and support structure is performed for a 10 MW spar FWT, considering four different control strategies, to evaluate the effect of the controller on the structural design and associated costs. The introduction of velocity feedback control reduces the platform pitch response and consequently the fatigue loads in the tower, which leads to a decrease in the tower costs compared to a simple PI controller. Low-pass filtering of the nacelle velocity signal to remove the wave-frequency components results in reduced rotor speed variation, but offers only small improvements in costs, likely due to the limited wave-frequency response for the considered designs. Comparisons with nonlinear time-domain simulations show that the linearized model is able to capture trends with acceptable accuracy, but that significant overpredictions may occur for the platform pitch response.},

These future aircraft concepts include the STARC-ABL, D8 and N-3X among other examples. While BLI technology appears to be promising for improving the aircraft performance by reducing fuel burn, the benefits and challenges of using this technology are not well understood. As a result, there are a number of e orts ongoing within NASA which are attempting to model BLI and determine its overall bene t. Despite their common goal, there seems to be significant differences in the modeling approaches used in each e ort, with limited communication and collaboration between these groups. The purpose of this report is to document NASA's in-house BLI modeling e orts and their associated methodologies. Furthermore, the report will identify strengths and weaknesses of each methodology, specifically in regards to each method's application in conceptual design.},

A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.

 abstract = {In a composite material, stiffness and strength in a desired direction can be controlled via the combination and stacking of materials. As such, the application of composite materials has spread to almost every industry. To utilize this advantage in the design of a marine propeller with complex geometry, accurate and practical analysis tools that consider both the hydroelastic behavior and ply-stacking structure of composite materials are required. Therefore, steady and unsteady BEM--FEM FSI algorithms of a composite propeller blade and a simple finite element model that considers the lamination modulus of fiber materials have been introduced in this study. In addition, a comparative study using CFD--FEM-based FSI analysis and numerical investigation of the hydroelastic behavior of a composite propeller in the ship wake field have been performed based on the present methodology.},

@inproceedings{Hypersizer,
 abstract = { Rapid structural analysis tools have become an important part of the design cycle for aerospace companies for the last several decades. As these tools have been developed over time, there is often little consideration for shared software infrastructure between the tools, which makes design and analysis cumbersome due to a lack of commonality in input and output data and reporting, as well as poor traceability of results. Under the Rapid Tools task of the Advanced Composites Consortium (ACC), four aerospace tools were recently implemented or enhanced in the HyperSizer{\textregistered} stress framework and then evaluated by this consortium of industry and government organizations. The framework provides an automated software environment for executing the rapid tools for analysis and sizing, quantifying margins of safety for thousands of load cases, and generating reports in support of FAA certification. This paper describes the process by which the tools were enhanced or implemented in the stress framework under the ACC project, and the evaluation conducted by industry consortium members. },

@conference{Iorga2016,
 abstract = {Preliminary sizing of aircraft structures is an inherently complex and costly exercise. In an industrial environ-
ment, this typically implies the early identification of structural dimensions with a good final-design represent-
ativeness, leading to a specific class of structural-optimisation problems with very many constraints and design
parameters. Further to the inherent complexities of the optimisation-problem formulation and solution, specific
conditions for robustness and interoperability with the industrial design processes have to be also considered.
This paper aims to introduce recent developments at Airbus for large-scale numerical optimisation of both metal-
lic and composite structures, in the form of the Advanced Composite/Metallic Optimisation frameworks. First,
the approaches chosen to address the structural-optimisation problem are described. Second, industry-specific siz-
ing criteria and associated solutions are reviewed, including the specific requirements for constraints arising from
stress criteria for static-stress and fatigue-and-damage-tolerance analyses, as well as from design criteria (like
manufacturing ramp rates). Finally, prospects for further academic and applied research are discussed, covering
multi-fidelity/multi-scale aspects as well as model parameterisation and loadspace characterisation techniques.},

 abstract = {As engineers increasingly pursue air vehicle designs with slender, lightweight aerostructures, it has become necessary to model nonlinear aeroelastic effects earlier in the design process. As a result, high-fidelity analysis tools are required that can efficiently identify flutter within the flight envelope, and find design modifications to alleviate adverse aeroelastic behavior. To address these requirements, we have systematically evaluated automated methods to identify the damping of an aeroelastic system from a time-domain simulation. The techniques evaluated include the log decrement method, envelope function methods that use the Hilbert transformation, the half-power bandwidth method, and the matrix pencil method. The optimal approach was determined to be the matrix pencil method due to its robustness to noise and its ability to handle multi-component signals over short time simulations. Identification of the flutter boundary of the AGARD-445.6 wing is demonstrated with an automated method based on the adjoint sensitivities and the matrix pencil method. While the matrix pencil method is robust, identification of the flutter boundary using gradient-based optimization is shown to be sensitive to the initial dynamic pressure guess.},

 abstract = {These Lecture Notes review the formulation and application of optimization techniques based on control theory for aerodynamic shape design in both inviscid and viscous compressible flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Frechet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. Representative results are presented for viscous optimization of transonic wing-body combinations.},

 abstract = {This article traces the evolution of long range jet transport aircraft over the 50 years since Kuechemann founded the journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences. The article is particularly focused on transonic aerodynamics. During Kuechemann's life time a good qualitative understanding had been achieved of transonic flow and swept wing design, but transonic flow remained intractable to quantitative prediction. During the last 50 years this situation has been completely transformed by the introduction of sophisticated numerical algorithms and an astonishing increase in the available computational power, with the consequence that aerodynamic design is now carried out largely by computer simulation. Moreover developments in aerodynamic shape optimization based on control theory enable a competitive swept wing to be designed in just two simulations, as illustrated in the article. While the external appearance of long range jet aircraft has not changed much, advances in information technology have actually transformed the entire design and manufacturing process through parallel advances in computer aided design (CAD), computational structural mechanics (CSM) and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO). They have also transformed aircraft operations through the adoption of digital fly-by-wire and advanced navigational techniques.},

Open-source software exists for low-fidelity aerodynamic or structural analysis, but there is no existing software for fast tightly coupled aerostructural analysis and design optimization. To address this need, we present OpenAeroStruct, an open-source low-fidelity aerostructural analysis and optimization tool developed in NASA's OpenMDAO framework. It uses the coupled adjoint method to compute the derivatives required for efficient gradient-based optimization. OpenAeroStruct combines a vortex lattice method and 1-D finite-element analysis to model lifting surfaces, such as aircraft wings and tails, and uses the coupled-adjoint method to compute the aerostructural derivatives. We use the Breguet range equation to compute the fuel burn as a function of structural weight and aerodynamic performance. OpenAeroStruct has proved effective both as an educational tool and as a benchmark for researching new MDO methods. There is much more potential to be exploited as the research community continues to develop and use this tool.},

A Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept has been developed which offers advantages over traditional metallic structure. In this concept a stitched carbon-epoxy material system has been developed with the potential for reducing the weight and cost of transport aircraft structure by eliminating fasteners, thereby reducing part count and labor. By adding unidirectional carbon rods to the top of stiffeners, the panel becomes more structurally efficient. This combination produces a more damage tolerant design. This document describes the results of experimentation on PRSEUS specimens loaded in unidirectional compression subjected to impact damage and loaded in fatigue and to failure. A comparison with analytical predictions for pristine and damaged specimens is included.},

 abstract = {Compared to non-cavitating flow, cavitating flow is much complex owing to the numerical difficulties caused by cavity generation and collapse. In this paper, the cavitating flow around a NACA66 hydrofoil is studied numerically with particular emphasis on understanding the cavitation structures and the shedding dynamics. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was coupled with a homogeneous cavitation model to calculate the pressure, velocity, vapor volume fraction and vorticity around the hydrofoil. The predicted cavitation shedding dynamics behavior, including the cavity growth, break-off and collapse downstream, agrees fairly well with experiment. Some fundamental issues such as the transition of a cavitating flow structure from 2D to 3D associated with cavitation--vortex interaction are discussed using the vorticity transport equation for variable density flow. A simplified one-dimensional model for the present configuration is adopted and calibrated against the LES results to better clarify the physical mechanism for the cavitation induced pressure fluctuations. The results verify the relationship between pressure fluctuations and the cavity shedding process (e.g. the variations of the flow rate and cavity volume) and demonstrate that the cavity volume acceleration is the main source of the pressure fluctuations around the cavitating hydrofoil. This research provides a better understanding of the mechanism driving the cavitation excited pressure pulsations, which will facilitate development of engineering designs to control these vibrations.},

 abstract = {A robust optimization design approach of natural laminar airfoils is developed in this paper. First, the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) free form deformation method based on NURBS basis function is introduced to the airfoil parameterization. Second, aerodynamic characteristics are evaluated by solving Navier--Stokes equations, and the γ-Reθt¯ transition model coupling with shear-stress transport (SST) turbulent model is introduced to simulate boundary layer transition. A numerical simulation of transition flow around NLF0416 airfoil is conducted to test the code. The comparison between numerical simulation results and wind tunnel test data approves the validity and applicability of the present transition model. Third, the optimization system is set up, which uses the separated particle swarm optimization (SPSO) as search algorithm and combines the Kriging models as surrogate model during optimization. The system is applied to carry out robust design about the uncertainty of lift coefficient and Mach number for NASA NLF-0115 airfoil. The data of optimized airfoil aerodynamic characteristics indicates that the optimized airfoil can maintain laminar flow stably in an uncertain range and has a wider range of low drag.},

 abstract = {A behavior is ``contagious'' if one person is more likely to exhibit it when a relevant other person has already done so. In this sense, behavioral contagion is commonly thought to contribute to many social problems, such as drug abuse and teenage promiscuity. In this paper we focus on behavioral contagion in sibships. Borrowing a model from the theory of contagious diseases, we show that contagion will cause prevalence to increase with sibship size. This model also allows us to estimate the magnitude of the contagious factor relative to non-contagious factors. Finally, we develop two statistical tests for the presence of contagion. Results are presented for participation in a skill-development program and four child-psychiatric conditions: neurosis, hyperactivity, somatization, and conduct disorder. Evidence is presented that program participation is probably contagious and conduct disorder possibly so. The other three child-psychiatric conditions are shown not to be contagious. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

 abstract = {The authors present a new global optimization algorithm for minimizing a multivariate function subject to lower and upper bounds on the variables. The new algorithm uses the space-partitioning approach common to many Lipschitzian, interval-analysis, and Bayesian algorithms. It differs from these methods in its use of a new criterion for selecting regions for further search. This new criterion speeds up convergence by giving the algorithm the ability to perform both local and global search at the same time. Thus, once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part quickly and automatically exploits it. The objective function is treated as a black box that need not be differentiable or Lipschitzian. Results are given for nine standard test functions.<>},

 abstract = {Today, most successful applications of optimization in the automotive industry are at the detailed-design level. Examples include structural optimization of metal gauges and beam cross sections, topology optimization of cast parts, and engine calibration. Despite these successes, it is fair to say that optimization is used less often, and has had a smaller impact, than most researchers might have expected. The reason is the presence of numerous barriers, such as poor connections between computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided engineering (CAE) software, insufficient predictive accuracy of computer simulations, difficulty in automating and iterating computer analyses, long simulation times, and poor availability of data. As a result, until recently, the focus has just been on getting to the point where we can do optimization. Fortunately, many of these barriers are being overcome, and the next decade is likely to witness a fast growth in the use of optimization within the industry. Accordingly, the focus will shift to more interesting challenges, such as robust design, multi-disciplinary optimization, and the roll-down of vehicle-level requirements to subsystem specifications.},

Moreover, the shapes can have holes and the material can have defective areas. Finally, the shapes can be arranged using both translations and arbitrary rotations (as opposed to a finite set of rotation angles, such as 0{\$}{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ {\$}{\$}∘and 180{\$}{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ {\$}{\$}∘). The insight that has made all this possible is a novel way to relax the constraint that the shapes not overlap. The key idea is to inscribe a few circles in each irregular shape and then relax the non-overlap constraints for the shapes by replacing them with non-overlap constraints for the inscribed circles. These relaxed problems have the form of quadratic programming problems (QPs) and can be solved to optimality to provide valid lower bounds. Valid upper bounds can be found via local search with strict non-overlap constraints. If the shapes overlap in the solution to the relaxed problem, new circles are inscribed in the shapes to prevent this overlapping configuration from recurring, and the QP is then resolved to obtain improved lower bounds. Convergence to any fixed tolerance is guaranteed in a finite number of iterations. A specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, together with some heuristics, are introduced to find the initial inscribed circles that approximate the shapes. The new approach, called ``QP-Nest,''is applied to three problems as proof of concept. The most complicated of these is a problem due to Milenkovic that has four nonconvex polygons with 94, 72, 84, and 74 vertices, respectively. QP-Nest is able prove global optimality when nesting the first two or the first three of these shapes. When all four shapes are considered, QP-Nest finds the best known solution, but cannot prove optimality.},

@article{Jones2021a,
 abstract = {Introduced in 1993, the DIRECT global optimization algorithm provided a fresh approach to minimizing a black-box function subject to lower and upper bounds on the variables.
In contrast to the plethora of nature-inspired heuristics, DIRECT was deterministic and had only one hyperparameter (the desired accuracy).
Moreover, the algorithm was simple, easy to implement, and usually performed well on low-dimensional problems (up to six-variables).
Most importantly, DIRECT balanced local and global search (exploitation versus exploration) in a unique way: in each iteration, several points were sampled, some for global and some for local search.
This approach eliminated the need for ``tuning parameters'' that set the balance between local and global search.

However, the very same features that made DIRECT simple and conceptually attractive also created weaknesses.
For example, it was commonly observed that, while DIRECT is often fast to find the basin of the global optimum, it can be slow to fine-tune the solution to high accuracy.
In this paper, we identify several such weaknesses and survey the work of various researchers to extend DIRECT so that it performs better.
All of the extensions show substantial improvement over DIRECT on various test functions.
An outstanding challenge is to improve performance robustly across problems of different degrees of difficulty, ranging from simple (unimodal, few variables) to very hard (multimodal, sharply peaked, many variables).
Opportunities for further improvement may lie in combining the best features of the different extensions.},

In this article, a modified kriging method is proposed, which has an unknown mean model. Therefore, it is called blind kriging. The unknown mean model is identified from experimental data using a Bayesian variable selection technique. Many examples are presented, which show remarkable improvement in prediction using blind kriging over ordinary kriging. Moreover, a blind kriging predictor is easier to interpret and seems to be more robust against mis-specification in the correlation parameters.}},

@article{Joshy2021a,
 abstract = {Large-scale system design optimization is a numerical technique used in solving system design problems that involve a large number of design variables. These systems are often multidisciplinary, with many disciplines interacting with each other. The scale of these problems demands a gradient-based approach for efficient solutions, and it is often implemented by coupling an engineering model with an optimizer. A recently developed theory on multidisciplinary derivative computation has made it feasible to solve large-scale system design optimization problems in only hundreds of model evaluations. This has led to an increase in the number of applications for large-scale system design optimization with new applications still emerging. This paper presents a new optimization formulation that can further reduce the required number of model evaluations by unifying two widely used optimization architectures, namely, multidisciplinary feasible, and simultaneous analysis and design. Complex engineering systems that require solutions of large nonlinear systems can potentially benefit from this new formulation, and the optimized solutions can be reached in just tens of equivalent model evaluations. We demonstrate this order of magnitude improvement using a bar design problem. The paper also provides details on the practical implementation of this new formulation in an equality-constrained optimization setting. },

 abstract = {High-performance composite materials exhibit both anisotropic strength and stiffness properties. These anisotropic properties can be used to produce highly-tailored aircraft structures that meet stringent performance requirements, but these properties also present unique challenges for analysis and design. New tools and techniques are developed to address some of these important challenges. A homogenization-based theory for beams is developed to accurately predict the through-thickness stress and strain distribution in thick composite beams. Numerical comparisons demonstrate that the proposed beam theory can be used to obtain highly accurate results in up to three orders of magnitude less computational time than three-dimensional calculations. Due to the large finite-element model requirements for thin composite structures used in aerospace applications, parallel solution methods are explored. A parallel direct Schur factorization method is developed. The parallel scalability of the direct Schur approach is demonstrated for a large finite-element problem with over 5 million unknowns. In order to address manufacturing design requirements, a novel laminate parametrization technique is presented that takes into account the discrete nature of the ply-angle variables, and ply-contiguity constraints. This parametrization technique is demonstrated on a series of structural optimization problems including compliance minimization of a plate, buckling design of a stiffened panel and layup design of a full aircraft wing. The design and analysis of composite structures for aircraft is not a stand-alone problem and cannot be performed without multidisciplinary considerations. A gradient-based aerostructural design optimization framework is presented that partitions the disciplines into distinct process groups. An approximate Newton--Krylov method is shown to be an efficient aerostructural solution algorithm and excellent parallel scalability of the algorithm is demonstrated. An induced drag optimization study is performed to compare the trade-off between wing weight and induced drag for wing tip extensions, raked wing tips and winglets. The results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a 43% induced drag reduction with no weight penalty, a 28% induced drag reduction with a 10% wing weight reduction, or a 20% wing weight reduction with a 5% induced drag penalty from a baseline wing obtained from a structural mass-minimization problem with fixed aerodynamic loads.},

In the proposed technique, the classical laminate stiffnesses are expressed as a linear combination of the discrete options and design-variable weights. An exact l1 penalty function is employed to drive the designs towards discrete, 0-1 designs. The proposed tech- nique can be used as either an alternative or as an enhancement to SIMP-type methods, such as discrete material optimization (DMO). Unlike mixed-integer approaches, our laminate parametrization technique is well suited for gradient-based design optimization. The proposed laminate parametrization is demonstrated on compliance design of laminated plates and buckling design of a laminated stiffened panel. The results demonstrate that the approach is an effective alternative to DMO methods.},

 abstract = {Current and future composite material technologies have the potential to greatly improve the performance of large transport aircraft. However, the coupling between aerodynamics and structures makes it challenging to design optimal flexible wings, and the transonic flight regime requires high fidelity computational models. We address these challenges by solving a series of high-fidelity aerostructural optimization problems that explore the design space for the wing of a large transport aircraft. We consider three different materials: aluminum, carbon-fiber reinforced composites and an hypothetical composite based on carbon nanotubes. The design variables consist of both aerodynamic shape (including span), structural sizing, and ply angle fractions in the case of composites. Pareto fronts with respect to structural weight and fuel burn are generated. The wing performance in each case is optimized subject to stress and buckling constraints. We found that composite wings consistently resulted in lower fuel burn and lower structural weight, and that the carbon nanotube composite did not yield the increase in performance one would expect from a material with such outstanding properties. This indicates that there might be diminishing returns when it comes to the application of advanced materials to wing design, requiring further investigation.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a sequential convex optimization method for minimum compliance design of multimaterial problems. The proposed method uses a multimaterial parametrization based on SIMP or RAMP penalization. At each iteration of the algorithm, a convex subproblem is constructed by forming a nonlinear, convex approximation of the penalized compliance based on a linearization of the stiffness matrix. Subsequent solutions of the convex subproblems form a non-increasing sequence of compliance values. The subproblems are solved using a tailored inexact Newton--Krylov interior point method that leverages relatively inexpensive Hessian-vector products. The algorithm is demonstrated on a series of isotropic and orthotropic multimaterial plane stress design problems.},

 abstract = {Structured mesh computational fluid dynamic solvers are inherently faster than unstructured solvers, which is particularly advantageous for aerodynamic design optimization, where hundreds of flow solutions are required. However, generating body-fitted multiblock meshes for complex geometries is challenging and is a time consuming task. The overset mesh technique greatly reduces the manual effort required to generate meshes over complex geometries by overlapping a series of simpler meshes. However, generating the necessary connectivity information between meshes in a robust and computationally efficient manner remains a challenge. We address this challenge by developing an efficient parallel overset grid assembly technique based on implicit hole cutting that is fully automatic. The method is fully parallel and scales to hundreds of processors. Several optimizations of the Common Research Model wing-body-tail configuration are performed using the meshes generated by our technique. We compare the best drag reduction obtained from multiblock and overset meshes using two different artificial dissipation schemes. The smooth, highly orthogonal overset meshes produce better results than the multiblock meshes, by up to 3 drag counts. An application to rotorcraft design is also presented. The demonstrated meshing flexibility and accurate transonic solutions make the overset mesh technique ideally suited for aerodynamic shape optimization.},

@article{Kenway2019a,
 abstract = {The adjoint method  is used for high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization and is an efficient approach for computing the derivatives of a function of interest with respect to a large number of design variables. Over the past few decades, various approaches have been used to implement the adjoint method in computational fluid dynamics solvers. However, further advances in the field are hindered by the lack of performance assessments that compare the various adjoint implementations. Therefore, we propose open benchmarks and report a comprehensive evaluation of the various approaches to adjoint implementation. We also make recommendations on effective approaches, that is, approaches that are efficient, accurate, and have a low implementation cost. We focus on the discrete adjoint method and describe adjoint implementations for two computational fluid dynamics solvers by using various methods for computing the partial derivatives in the adjoint equations and for solving those equations. Both source code transformation and operator-overloading algorithmic differentiation tools are used to compute the partial derivatives, along with finite differencing. We also examine the use of explicit Jacobian and Jacobian-free solution methods. We quantitatively evaluate the speed, scalability, memory usage, and accuracy of the various implementations by running cases that cover a wide range of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, mesh topologies, mesh sizes, and CPU cores. We conclude that the Jacobian-free method using source code transformation algorithmic differentiation to compute the partial derivatives is the best option because it computes exact derivatives with the lowest CPU time and the lowest memory requirements, and it also scales well up to 10 million cells and over one thousand CPU cores. The superior performance of this approach is primarily due to its Jacobian-free adjoint strategy. The cases presented herein are publicly available and represent platform-independent benchmarks for comparing other current and future adjoint implementations. Our results and discussion provide a guide for discrete adjoint implementations, not only for computational fluid dynamics but also for a wide range of other partial differential equation solvers.},

 abstract = {A combined aerodynamic and structural, gradient-based optimization has been performed on the NASA/Boeing Common Research Model civil transport aircraft configuration. The computation of aerodynamic performance parameters includes a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD solver, coupling to a linear static structural analysis using the finite element method to take into account aero-elastic effects. Aerodynamic performance gradients are computed using the adjoint approach. Within each optimization iteration, the wing's structure is sized via a gradient-based algorithm and an updated structure model is forwarded for the performance analysis. In this pilot study wing profile shape is optimized in order to study engine installation effects. This setting was able to improve the aerodynamic performance by 4\%.},

 abstract = {Hybrid classical--quantum algorithms aim to variationally solve optimization problems using a feedback loop between a classical computer and a quantum co-processor, while benefiting from quantum resources. Here we present experiments that demonstrate self-verifying, hybrid, variational quantum simulation of lattice models in condensed matter and high-energy physics. In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.},

@incollection{Kowarschik2003a,
 abstract = {In order to mitigate the impact of the growing gap between CPU speed and main memory performance, today's computer architectures implement hierarchical memory structures. The idea behind this approach is to hide both the low main memory bandwidth and the latency of main memory accesses which is slow in contrast to the floating-point performance of the CPUs. Usually, there is a small and expensive high speed memory sitting on top of the hierarchy which is usually integrated within the processor chip to provide data with low latency and high bandwidth; i.e., the CPU registers. Moving further away from the CPU, the layers of memory successively become larger and slower. The memory components which are located between the processor core and main memory are called cache memories or caches. They are intended to contain copies of main memory blocks to speed up accesses to frequently needed data [378], [392]. The next lower level of the memory hierarchy is the main memory which is large but also comparatively slow. While external memory such as hard disk drives or remote memory components in a distributed computing environment represent the lower end of any common hierarchical memory design, this paper focuses on optimization techniques for enhancing cache performance.},

@article{KRAMER2013CS,
 abstract = {Composite materials are being used more frequently for marine applications due to the advantages of a higher stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratio, and better corrosion resistance compared to metallic alloys. Many examples consist of cantilevered structures, such as hydrofoils, propeller and turbine blades, keels, and rudders. A wide range of analytical and numerical tools exist for the free vibration analysis of composite structures in air due to their applicability to design problems in the aerospace industry, such as airplane wings, turbofan and propeller blades, and flight control surfaces. For these aerospace structures the inertial effects of the fluid are typically neglected due to the low relative density of air compared to the structure. Contrarily, for marine structures, fluid inertial (added mass) effects cannot be neglected, especially for composites with much higher fluid-to-solid density ratios. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of material anisotropy and added mass on the free vibration response of rectangular, cantilevered composite plates/beams via combined analytical and numerical modeling. The results show that the natural frequencies of the composite plate are 50{\^a}70% lower in water than in air due to large added mass effects. The added mass is found to vary considerably with material orientation due to the bend-twist coupling of anisotropic composites, which affects the mode shapes and, consequently, the fluid inertial loads. The analytical method is found to yield accurate results for beam geometries and offers significant savings in computational cost compared to the finite element method.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulation is already an important cornerstone for aircraft design, although the application of highly accurate methods is mainly limited to the design point. To meet future technical, economic and social challenges in aviation, it is essential to simulate a real aircraft at an early stage, including all multidisciplinary interactions covering the entire flight envelope, and to have the ability to provide data with guaranteed accuracy required for development and certification. However, despite the considerable progress made there are still significant obstacles to be overcome in the development of numerical methods, physical modeling, and the integration of different aircraft disciplines for multidisciplinary analysis and optimization of realistic aircraft configurations. At DLR, these challenges are being addressed in the framework of the multidisciplinary project Digital-X (4/2012--12/2015). This paper provides an overview of the project objectives and presents first results on enhanced disciplinary methods in aerodynamics and structural analysis, the development of efficient reduced order methods for load analysis, the development of a multidisciplinary optimization process based on a multi-level/variable-fidelity approach, as well as the development and application of multidisciplinary methods for the analysis of maneuver loads.},

A first-order framework is given for design procedures aimed at achieving a given flight performance. Only major types of aircraft are considered and some of the characteristic features which distinguish them are described. The types are: classical and swept aircraft for flight at subsonic and low supersonic speeds; slender wings for flight at supersonic speeds and also for subsonic flight over very short ranges; and waverider aircraft for flight at hypersonic speeds. The prospects for further development of the existing types and for the establishment of the as yet hypothetical types are discussed. The evolution of the aerodynamic shape is shown to lead to a complete spectrum of major types of aircraft, supplemented by special types designed for particular purposes.},

An efficient one-dimensional GO method using local tuning on the behavior of the objective function is generalized to the multi-dimensional case by the diagonal approach using two partition strategies. Global convergence conditions are established for the obtained diagonal geometric methods. Results of a wide numerical comparison show a strong acceleration reached by the new methods working with estimates of the local Lipschitz constants over different subregions of the search domain in comparison with the traditional approach.},

In particular, it is formulated as a problem of global minimization of a multiextremal black-box function over a multidimensional hyperinterval. A global optimization technique, recently proposed, is used for solving the stated problem: the search hyperinterval is partitioned into smaller hyperintervals and the objective function is evaluated only at two vertices corresponding to the main diagonal of the generated hyperintervals, thus avoiding unnecessary ponderous simulations. Then, the performances of this technique are numerically compared with ones of a genetic algorithm (GA).},

The geometry of these test objects varied in the spanwise direction (i.e. three-dimensional test objects). Closed cavities formed on these test objects. The interface of the closed cavities curved smoothly to form a re-entrant jet at the cavity terminus, and the re-entrant flow was directed spanwise, thus preventing its impingement on the cavity interface. The cavity shape and the pressure gradients near the closure of the closed cavities were qualitatively similar to those predicted with the two-dimensional free-streamline theory. These cavities had a steady, laminar flow reattachment. The flow around the closed cavity was largely irrotational.},

@article{Lang2009,
 abstract = {Coded aperture imaging (CAI) has evolved as a standard technique for imaging high-energy photon sources and has found numerous applications. Coded aperture arrays (CAAs) are the most important devices in the applications of CAI. In recent years, many approaches were presented to design optimum or near-optimum CAAs. Uniformly redundant arrays (URAs) are the most successful CAAs for their cyclic autocorrelation consisting of a sequence of delta functions on a flat sidelobe, which can easily be subtracted when the object has been reconstructed. Unfortunately, the existing methods can only be used to design URAs with limited number of array sizes and fixed autocorrelative sidelobe-to-peak ratio. In this paper, we presented a method to design more flexible URAs by means of a global optimization algorithm named DIRECT. By our approaches, we obtain various types of URAs including the filled URAs which can be constructed by existing methods and the sparse URAs which have never been constructed and mentioned by existing papers as far as we know.},

This book has served this purpose well. Numerical analysts, statisticians, and engineers have developed techniques and nomenclature for the least squares problems of their own discipline. This well-organized presentation of the basic material needed for the solution of least squares problems can unify this divergence of methods. Mathematicians, practising engineers, and scientists will welcome its return to print. The material covered includes Householder and Givens orthogonal transformations, the QR and SVD decompositions, equality constraints, solutions in nonnegative variables, banded problems, and updating methods for sequential estimation. Both the theory and practical algorithms are included. The easily understood explanations and the appendix providing a review of basic linear algebra make the book accessible for the non-specialist.},

 abstract = {Aerodynamic Shape Optimization using Discrete Adjoint Formulation based on Overset Mesh System Discrete Adjoint Approach;Overset Mesh Technique;Optimal Shape Design;S-BIG(Spline-Boundary Intersection Grid);Complex Geometry; A new design approach of complex geometries such as wing/body configuration is arranged by using overset mesh techniques under large scale computing environment. For an in-depth study of the flow physics and highly accurate design, several special overlapped structured blocks such as collar grid, tip-cap grid, and etc. which are commonly used in refined drag prediction are adopted to consider the applicability of the present design tools to practical problems. Various pre- and post-processing techniques for overset flow analysis and sensitivity analysis are devised or implemented to resolve overset mesh techniques into the design optimization problem based on Gradient Based Optimization Method (GBOM). In the pre-processing, the convergence characteristics of the flow solver and sensitivity analysis are improved by overlap optimization method. Moreover, a new post-processing method, Spline-Boundary Intersecting Grid (S-BIG) scheme, is proposed by considering the ratio of cell area for more refined prediction of aerodynamic coefficients and efficient evaluation of their sensitivities under parallel computing environment. With respect to the sensitivity analysis, discrete adjoint formulations for overset boundary conditions are derived by a full hand-differentiation. A smooth geometric modification on the overlapped surface boundaries and evaluation of grid sensitivities can be performed by mapping from planform coordinate to the surface meshes with Hicks-Henne function. Careful design works for the drag minimization problems of a transonic wing and a wing/body configuration are performed by using the newly-developed and -applied overset mesh techniques. The results from design applications demonstrate the capability of the present design approach successfully.},

@article{Leifsson2013a,
 abstract = {The idea of using distributed propulsion has been suggested with the objective of reducing aircraft noise. This paper investigates the effects of such a system on aircraft performance and weight. The distributed propulsion concept considered here involves replacing a small number of large engines with a moderate number of small engines and ducting part of the engine exhaust to exit out along the trailing edge of the wing. Models to describe the effects of this distributed propulsion concept were formulated and integrated into a multidisciplinary design optimization formulation. The most important effect modeled is the impact on the propulsive efficiency when there is blowing out of the trailing edge of a wing. An increase in propulsive efficiency is attainable with this arrangement as the trailing edge jet `fills in' the wake behind the body, improving the overall aerodynamic/propulsion system, resulting in an increased propulsive efficiency. Other models formulated include the effect of the trailing edge jet on the induced drag, longitudinal control through thrust vectoring of the trailing edge jet, increased weight due to the ducts, and thrust losses within the ducts. The Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft was used as a testbed in this study. Two different BWB configurations were optimized, a conventional propulsion BWB with four pylon mounted engines and a distributed propulsion BWB with eight boundary layer ingestion inlet engines, for a mission of 7750 nm at Mach 0.85 carrying 478 passengers. The results show that the optimum BWB designs have comparable planform shapes and TOGW of approximately 860,000 lb, but have different weight distributions. The distributed propulsion BWB has a heavier propulsion system (+17.5%) and a lighter wing (−11.5%) than the conventional propulsion BWB. Although the distributed propulsion BWB has a 1.6% higher lift-to-drag ratio than the conventional propulsion BWB, the fuel weight is still 1.2% higher, mainly due to 3.8% higher specific fuel consumption associated with smaller turbofan engines. The results furthermore show that more than two-thirds of the possible savings due to filling in the wake will be required to obtain this optimum design. Achieving such high savings by filling in the wake will be challenging. However, by developing more efficient small turbofan engines and reducing the distributed propulsion system weight, the necessary savings by filling in the wake will be achieved.},

 abstract = {Surrogate-based optimization is criticized in high-dimensional cases because it cannot scale well with the input dimension. In order to overcome this issue, we adopt a snapshot active subspace method to reduce the input dimension. A smoothing operation of samples is used to reduce the demand for snapshots in the construction of active subspaces. This operation significantly reduces the computational cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, it leads to more feasible subspaces. We use a 90{\^a}{\OE}95{\%} energy coverage criterion to define the dimension of the subspace. With this criterion, the surrogate-based airfoil optimization in the active subspace is both efficient and effective. We also validate this optimization approach in an ONERA M6 wing optimization case with 220 shape variables. Compared with original surrogate-based optimization, the new approach reduces the computational time by 70{\%} and obtains a more practical design with a smaller drag.},

@article{Li2020a,
 abstract = {Surrogate-based optimization has been used in aerodynamic shape optimization, but it has been limited due to the curse of dimensionality. Although a large number of variables are required for the shape parameterization, many of the shapes that the parameterization can produce are abnormal and do not add meaningful information to a surrogate model. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based optimization, recent machine learning techniques are applied in this study to reduce the abnormality of both initial and infill samples. This paper proposes a new sampling method for airfoils and wings, which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. This network is trained to learn the underlying features among the existing airfoils and is able to generate sample airfoils that are notably more realistic than those generated by other sampling methods. In addition, a discriminative model is developed based on convolutional neural networks. This model detects the geometric abnormality of airfoils or wing sections quickly without using expensive computational fluid dynamic models. These machine learning models are embedded in a surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization framework and perform aerodynamic shape optimization for airfoils and wings. The results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional methods, our proposed models can double the optimization efficiency.

 abstract = {The convergence of high-order methods, such as recently developed spectral difference (SD) method, can be accelerated using both implicit temporal advancement and a p-multigrid (p=polynomial degree) approach. A p-multigrid method is investigated in this paper for solving SD formulations of the scalar wave and Euler equations on unstructured grids. A fast preconditioned lower--upper symmetric Gauss--Seidel (LU-SGS) relaxation method is implemented as an iterative smoother. Meanwhile, a Runge--Kutta explicit method is employed for comparison. The multigrid method considered here is nonlinear and utilizes full approximation storage (FAS) [Ta'asan S. Multigrid one-shot methods and design strategy, Von Karman Institute Lecture Note, 1997 [28]] scheme. For some p-multigrid calculations, blending implicit and explicit smoothers for different p-levels is also studied. The p-multigrid method is firstly validated by solving both linear and nonlinear 2D wave equations. Then the same idea is extended to 2D nonlinear Euler equations. Generally speaking, we are able to achieve speedups of up to two orders using the p-multigrid method with the implicit smoother.},

 abstract = {Two approaches are examined for seeking the best stacking sequence of laminated composite wing structures with manufacturing constraints: smeared stiffness-based method and lamination parameter-based method. In the first method, minimizing the total number of plies is the objective function at the global level and shuffling the stack of all the layers to satisfy manufacturing constraints is optimized at the local level. The second method introduced in this paper is to use lamination parameters related with out-of-plane stiffness matrix and numbers of ply angle (90, 0, 45/-45) as design variables with considerations of buckling and strength constraints in the top level optimization. Given lamination parameters from top level optimization as objective function for the local level, optimal stacking sequence will be determined to satisfy industrial manufacturing requirements. The results of a three-part wing box example using these two approaches are compared to results from published papers to demonstrate their potencies.},

 abstract = {Heterogeneous multiprocessor systems, where commodity multicore processors are coupled with graphics processing units (GPUs), have been widely used in high performance computing (HPC). In this work, we focus on the design and optimization of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications on such HPC platforms. In order to fully utilize the computational power of such heterogeneous platforms, we propose to design the performance-critical part of CFD applications, namely the linear equation solvers, in a hybrid way. A hybrid linear solver includes both one CPU version and one GPU version of code for solving a linear equations system. When a hybrid linear equation solver is invoked during the CFD simulation, the CPU portion and the GPU portion will be run on corresponding processing devices respectively in parallel according to the execution configuration. Furthermore, we propose to build functional performance models (FPMs) of processing devices and use FPM-based heterogeneous decomposition method to distribute workload between heterogeneous processing devices, in order to ensure balanced workload and optimized communication overhead. Efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by experiments with numerical simulation of lid-driven cavity flow on both a hybrid server and a hybrid cluster.},

 abstract = {Recent metamodel-based global optimization algorithms are very promising for box-constrained expensive optimization problems. However, few of them can tackle constrained optimization problems. This article presents an improved constrained optimization algorithm, called eDIRECT-C, for expensive constrained optimization problems. In the eDIRECT-C algorithm, we present a novel DIRECT-type constraint-handling technique that separately handles feasible and infeasible cells. This technique has no user-defined parameter and is beneficial for exploring the undetected feasible regions and boundary of feasible regions. We also employ an adaptive metamodeling strategy to build appropriate metamodel types for objective and constraints respectively. This strategy yields more accurate predictions and therefore significantly speeds up the convergence. To assess the performance of eDIRECT-C, we compare it with some state-of-the-art metamodel-based constrained optimization algorithms and the original DIRECT algorithm on 13 benchmark problems and 4 engineering examples. The comparative results imply that the proposed algorithm is very promising for constrained problems in terms of the convergence speed, quality of final solutions and success rate.},

 abstract = {Metamodeling is becoming a rather popular means to approximate the expensive simulations in today's complex engineering design problems since accurate metamodels can bring in a lot of benefits. The metamodel accuracy, however, heavily depends on the locations of the observed points. Adaptive sampling, as its name suggests, places more points in regions of interest by learning the information from previous data and metamodels. Consequently, compared to traditional space-filling sampling approaches, adaptive sampling has great potential to build more accurate metamodels with fewer points (simulations), thereby gaining increasing attention and interest by both practitioners and academicians in various fields. Noticing that there is a lack of reviews on adaptive sampling for global metamodeling in the literature, which is needed, this article categorizes, reviews, and analyzes the state-of-the-art single−/multi-response adaptive sampling approaches for global metamodeling in support of simulation-based engineering design. In addition, we also review and discuss some important issues that affect the success of an adaptive sampling approach as well as providing brief remarks on adaptive sampling for other purposes. Last, challenges and future research directions are provided and discussed.},

 abstract = {DIRECT is derivative-free global-search algorithm has been found to perform robustly across a wide variety of low-dimensional test problems. The reason DIRECT's robustness is its lack of algorithmic parameters that need be ``tuned'' to make the algorithm perform well. In particular, there is no parameter that determines the relative emphasis on global versus local search. Unfortunately, the same algorithmic features that enable DIRECT to perform so robustly have a negative side effect. In particular, DIRECT is usually quick to get close to the global minimum, but very slow to refine the solution to high accuracy. This is what we call DIRECT's ``eventually inefficient behavior.'' In this paper, we outline two root causes for this undesirable behavior and propose modifications to eliminate it. The paper builds upon our previously published ``MrDIRECT'' algorithm, which we can now show only addressed the first root cause of the ``eventually inefficient behavior.'' The key contribution of the current paper is a further enhancement that allows MrDIRECT to address the second root cause as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced MrDIRECT, we have identified a set of test functions that highlight different situations in which DIRECT has convergence issues. Extensive numerical work with this test suite demonstrates that the enhanced version of MrDIRECT does indeed improve the convergence rate of DIRECT.},

 abstract = {Although DIRECT global optimization algorithm quickly gets close to the basin of the optimum, it often takes much longer to refine the solution to a high degree of accuracy. This behavior of DIRECT is similar to the ``smooth mode phenomenon'' encountered when solving linear systems discretized from partial differential equation (PDE). In the case of PDE, this smooth mode phenomenon can be eliminated efficiently by the multigrid algorithm in which the PDE solver is applied at different levels of discretization. In this paper we adapt the multigrid approach to a robust version of DIRECT algorithm, obtaining a ``multilevel'' robust DIRECT (MrDIRECT) algorithm. Although additional parameters are needed, our numerical results show that MrDIRECT is insensitive to the parameters, and the parameters setting proposed in this paper performs very well on the tested sets of benchmark problems, in terms of the speed with which the global optimum is found to a high degree of accuracy.},

We draw our inspiration from the well-known DIRECT algorithm which, by exploiting the objective function behavior, produces a set of points that tries to cover the most interesting regions of the feasible set. Unfortunately, it is well-known that this strategy suffers when the dimension of the problem increases. As a first step we define a multi-start algorithm using DIRECT as a deterministic generator of starting points. Then, the new algorithm consists in repeatedly applying the previous multi-start algorithm on suitable modifications of the variable space that exploit the information gained during the optimization process. The efficiency of the new algorithm is pointed out by a consistent numerical experimentation involving both standard test problems and the optimization of Morse potential of molecular clusters.},

However, the efficiency of DIRECT deteriorates as the dimension and the ill-conditioning of the objective function increase. To overcome these limits, we propose DIRECT-type algorithms enriched by the efficient use of derivative-free local searches combined with nonlinear transformations of the feasible domain and, possibly, of the objective function.

We have compared DIRECT with standard exhaustive search and a genetic algorithm previously used for QTL mapping in two dimensions. In all two- and three-QTL test cases, DIRECT accurately finds the global optimum two to four orders of magnitude faster than when using an exhaustive search, and one order of magnitude faster than when using the genetic algorithm.

 abstract = {A p-multigrid (p = polynomial degree) discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the solution of the compressible Euler equations on unstructured grids. The method operates on a sequence of solution approximations of different polynomial orders. A distinct feature of this p-multigrid method is to use different time integration schemes on different approximation levels, resulting in an accurate, fast, and low memory method that can be used to accelerate the convergence of the Euler equations to a steady state for discontinuous Galerkin methods. The developed method is used to compute the compressible flows for a variety of test problems on unstructured grids. The numerical results obtained strongly indicate the order independent property of this p-multigrid method. An overall speed-up factor more than one order of magnitude for both second- and third-order solutions of all test cases in comparison with the explicit method is demonstrated.},

 abstract = {<p>Adaptive morphing trailing edge wings have the potential to reduce the fuel burn of transport aircraft. In this paper, we quantify the aerodynamic performance benefits of a morphing trailing using aerodynamic design optimization. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The baseline geometry is optimized using a multipoint formulation with 192 shape design variables. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, geometric constraints, and a 2.5g maneuver bending moment constraint. The trailing edge of the wing is optimized based on the multipoint optimized wing. The trailing edge morphing is parameterized using 90 design variables that are optimized independently for each flight condition. A total of 407 trailing edge optimizations are performed with different flight conditions to span the entire flight envelope. We observed 1\% drag reduction at on-design conditions, and 5\% drag reduction near off-design conditions. The effectiveness of the trailing edge morphing is demonstrated by comparing with the optimized results of a hypothetical fully morphing wing. In addition, we compute the fuel burn reductions for a number of flights using the optimization results. A 1\% cruise fuel burn reduction is achieved using adaptive morphing trailing edge for a typical long-haul twin-aisle mission.</p>},

 abstract = {Despite considerable research on aerodynamic shape optimization, there is no standard benchmark problem allowing researchers to compare results. This work addresses this issue by solving a series of aerodynamic shape optimization problems based on the Common Research Model wing benchmark case defined by the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, and geometric constraints. A multilevel technique is used to reduce the computational cost of the optimization. A single-point optimization is solved with 720 shape variables using a 28.8-million-cell mesh, reducing the drag by 8.5%. A more realistic design is achieved through a multipoint optimization. Multiple local minima are found when starting from multiple randomly generated geometries, but the minimum drag values are within 0.1 drag counts of each other, and the geometries differ by only 0.4% of the mean aerodynamic chord. The effect of varying the number of shape design variables is examined. The Common Research Model wing benchmark problem proved to be useful for evaluating our design optimization framework, and the geometries and meshes for both the baseline and optimized wings are available as supplemental materials in this paper.

 abstract = {The D8 ``double-bubble'' is a new transport aircraft configuration proposed by MIT that has the potential to provide large improvements in fuel efficiency. It has been studied at the conceptual level and in low-speed wind tunnel tests, but there was, up to now, no higher fidelity transonic design. In this study, we use the conceptual design definition as a starting point and develop a high-fidelity aerostructural optimization problem for the D8 configuration using the MACH framework. Via gradient-based optimization techniques with coupled RANS and shell FEA, the D8 is optimized at three different cruise Mach numbers (0.72, 0.78, 0.84). The preliminary results presented confirm that the planforms designed with the conceptual level tools perform well and as predicted, and that some small improvements can be gained from further optimization. In spite of its limitations, this work confirms the viability of the D8 wing-body in the transonic regime and provides preliminary transonic geometries for future work.},

@article{Mader2020a,
 abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics through the solution of the Navier--Stokes equations with turbulence models has become commonplace. However, simply solving these equations is not sufficient to be able to perform efficient design optimization with a flow solver in the loop. This paper discusses the recommendations for developing a flow solver that is suitable for efficient aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization. One of the major recommendations is to be able to load the flow solver as a library that provides direct memory access to the relevant data. Other recommendations are to use a higher-level language for scripting and to pay special attention to solution warm starting, code efficiency, flow solver robustness, and solution failure handling. As an example of a flow solver that follows these recommendations, the open-source flow solver ADflow is presented. Results from aerodynamic optimization, aerostructural analysis, and aerostructural optimization using ADflow demonstrate the performance advantages claimed in the recommendations. The publication of these recommendations and the availability of the source code open the door for other solvers to adopt the same application programming interface. ADflow is part of a wider aerodynamic shape optimization tool suite that is also available under an open-source license.

 abstract = {The second-generation of supersonic civil transport has to match ambitious targets in terms of efficiency to be economically and environmentally viable. CFD-based design optimization offers a powerful approach to address the complex tradeoffs intrinsic to this novel configuration. We apply this approach to the design of airfoils and wings at both supersonic cruise conditions and lower-speed, off-design conditions. We perform single and multipoint optimization to minimize the drag over an ideal supersonic aircraft flight envelope and assess the influence of physical and numerical parameters on optimization accuracy and robustness. To obtain more favorable design tradeoffs between different flight regimes, we introduce morphing leading and trailing edge capabilities, and quantify their benefits against fixed-wing shapes. The optimized layouts outperform baseline supersonic reference designs over a range of flight conditions, with drag reductions from 4% up to 86% for airfoils, and between 24% and 74% reductions relative to a reference wing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables the fast and effective design of highly-efficient wings, capturing non-intuitive tradeoffs, and offering more in-depth physical insight into the optimal layouts.},

@inproceedings{Marmin2015,
 abstract = {This work deals with parallel optimization of expensive objective functions which are modelled as sample realizations of Gaussian processes. The study is formalized as a Bayesian optimization problem, or continuous multi-armed bandit problem, where a batch of {\$}{\$}q > 0{\$}{\$}arms is pulled in parallel at each iteration. Several algorithms have been developed for choosing batches by trading off exploitation and exploration. As of today, the maximum Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) selection rules appear as the most prominent approaches for batch selection. Here, we build upon recent work on the multipoint Expected Improvement criterion, for which an analytic expansion relying on Tallis' formula was recently established. The computational burden of this selection rule being still an issue in application, we derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the multipoint Expected Improvement, which aims at facilitating its maximization using gradient-based ascent algorithms. Substantial computational savings are shown in application. In addition, our algorithms are tested numerically and compared to state-of-the-art UCB-based batch-sequential algorithms. Combining starting designs relying on UCB with gradient-based EI local optimization finally appears as a sound option for batch design in distributed Gaussian Process optimization.},

 abstract = {The complex-step derivative approximation and its application to numerical algorithms are presented. Improvements to the basic method are suggested that further increase its accuracy and robustness and unveil the connection to algorithmic differentiation theory. A general procedure for the implementation of the complex-step method is described in detail and a script is developed that automates its implementation. Automatic implementations of the complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences. The resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses. Accuracy, robustness, ease of implementation and maintainability make these complex-step derivative approximation tools very attractive options for sensitivity analysis.},

We review our recent developments for each of these components, and present open-source tools made available for aerodynamic shape optimization. A variety of applications is presented, including the optimization of a supercritical airfoil starting from a circle, a web application that optimizes airfoils within a few seconds, aircraft aerodynamic and aerostructural optimization, and aeropropulsive optimization. We also review our experience with solving the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG) benchmarks and other problems in aerodynamic shape optimization. Among the ADODG benchmarks, we focus on the RANS-based problems and discuss some of the issues encountered, including the comparison between Euler and RANS results, and design space multimodality. The availability of these benchmarks and the open-source tools is expected to enable further studies and benchmarks in CFD-based aerodynamic design optimization and MDO.},

@article{Masters2017a,
 abstract = { A comprehensive review of aerofoil shape parameterization methods that can be used for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. Seven parameterization methods are considered for a range of design variables: class--shape transformations; B-splines; Hicks--Henne bump functions; a radial basis function domain element approach; B{\`e}zier surfaces; a singular-value decomposition modal extraction method; and the parameterized sections method. Because of the large range of variables involved, the most effective way to implement each method is first investigated. Their performances are then analyzed by considering the geometric shape recovery of over 2000 aerofoils using a range of design variables, testing the efficiency of design space coverage with respect to a given tolerance. It is shown that, for all the methods, between 20 and 25 design variables are needed to cover the full design space to within a geometric tolerance, with the singular-value decomposition method doing this most efficiently. A set of transonic aerofoil case studies are also presented, with geometric error and convergence of the resulting aerodynamic properties explored. These results show a strong relationship between geometric error and aerodynamic convergence and demonstrate that between 38 and 66 design variables may be needed to ensure aerodynamic convergence to within one drag and one lift count. },

 abstract = {A model for the prediction of laminar-turbulent transition processes was formulated. It is based on the LCTM (`Local Correlation-based Transition Modelling') concept, where experimental correlations are being integrated into standard convection-diffusion transport equations using local variables. The starting point for the model was the $\gamma$-Re$\theta$model already widely used in aerodynamics and turbomachinery CFD applications. Some of the deficiencies of the $\gamma$-Re$\theta$model, like the lack of Galilean invariance were removed. Furthermore, the Re$\theta$equation was avoided and the correlations for transition onset prediction have been significantly simplified. The model has been calibrated against a wide range of Falkner-Skan flows and has been applied to a variety of test cases.},

However, they have not produced a significant breakthrough in the area of nonlinear programming due to the fact that they have not addressed the issue of constraints in a systematic way. Only recently have several methods been proposed for handling nonlinear constraints by evolutionary algorithms for numerical optimization problems; however, these methods have several drawbacks, and the experimental results on many test cases have been disappointing. In this paper we (1) discuss difficulties connected with solving the general nonlinear programming problem; (2) survey several approaches that have emerged in the evolutionary computation community; and (3) provide a set of 11 interesting test cases that may serve as a handy reference for future methods. },

@article{Mishima1997,
 abstract = {High-speed propulsor blades often experience moderate to substantial amounts of unsteady cavitation, and up to now have been designed via design methods for noncavitating blades combined with methods for the analysis of cavitating flows in a trial-and-error manner. In this paper, a numerical nonlinear optimization algorithm is developed for the automated, systematic design of cavitating blades. The method is first applied to the design of propeller blades in uniform flow. The blade mean camber surface is defined via a cubic B-spline polygon net in order to facilitate the handling of the geometry, and to reduce the number of the design parameters. Noncavitating blade geometries designed by the present method are directly compared with those designed via an existing lifting-line/lifting-surface design approach. Finally, the optimization algorithm is applied to the design of cavitating blades in nonuniform flow. The objective of the design is to obtain maximum propeller efficiency for given conditions by allowing controlled amounts of sheet cavitation. Several constraints on the unsteady cavity characteristics, such as the area of cavity planform and the amplitudes of the cavity volume velocity harmonics, are incorporated in the optimization technique. The effect of the constraints on the efficiency of the propeller design is demonstrated with various test cases.},

 abstract = {A well-known example of global optimization that provides solutions within fixed error limits is optimization of functions with a known Lipschitz constant. In many real-life problems this constant is unknown. To address that, we propose a novel method called Pareto-Lipschitzian Optimization (PLO) that provides solutions within fixed error limits for functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. In the proposed approach, a set of all unknown Lipschitz constants is regarded as multiple criteria using the concept of Pareto Optimality (PO). We compare PLO to the existing algorithm DIRECT. We show that, in contrast to PLO, the DIRECT algorithm considers only a subset of PO decisions that are selected by a heuristic rule depending on an adjustable parameter. It means that some PO decisions are preferred to others. By contrast, PLO regards all PO decisions without preferences and is naturally suited to utilize highly parallel computing.

 abstract = {In this paper, a recently proposed global Lipschitz optimization algorithm Pareto-Lipschitzian Optimization with Reduced-set (PLOR) is further developed, investigated and applied to truss optimization problems. Partition patterns of the PLOR algorithm are similar to those of DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), which was widely applied to different real-life problems. However here a set of all Lipschitz constants is reduced to just two: the maximal and the minimal ones. In such a way the PLOR approach is independent of any user-defined parameters and balances equally local and global search during the optimization process. An expanded list of other well-known DIRECT-type algorithms is used in investigation and experimental comparison using the standard test problems and truss optimization problems. The experimental investigation shows that the PLOR algorithm gives very competitive results to other DIRECT-type algorithms using standard test problems and performs pretty well on real truss optimization problems.},

Odyss{\'e}e takes as input a Fortran program and a set of
variables and returns a new Fortran program computing the
derivatives of the original function with respect to the given
variables. Direct differentiation, producing a Jacobian matrix or
a gradient vector, and reverse mode, computing the linear
cotangent map, are implemented in Odyss{\'e}e. The available
strategies of differentiation are presented: they lead to
different computation speeds and memory requirements. We consider
problems belonging to optimal shape design in aeronautics. Some
implicit functional must be minimized over a set of possible
shapes, under the constraint that the stationary Euler equations
of the surrounding flow are verified. We describe the physical
problems and the numerical methods used for solving them. We
discuss the advantages and drawbacks of two different approaches
in the use of Odyss{\'e}e for solving the optimization problem.
These approaches are analyzed on several tes},

 abstract = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation (inverse problem)of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways. This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP)problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based)local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

 abstract = {The design of an airfoil structure involves the disciplines of aerodynamics and structural mechanics, both of which are considered in the design methodology presented in this article. The approach described in this article starts from a requirement formulation based on a time-series of spanwise lift distributions on a morphing wing, representing the mission profile of the aircraft as a whole. This allows to specify goals based directly on aerodynamic performances instead of prescribing fixed geometrical shapes. Using the aero-structural analysis tool presented here, together with a parametrization representing the airfoil outer shape as well as its mechanical properties, allows the formulation of a combined aero-structural optimization problem. Promising aerodynamic and structural morphing performances have been obtained by applying the method to a morphing concept using Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) as actuators. Although the coupled physics are considered and a detailed material model has been used, results can be obtained within reasonable computational time by parallel evaluation of the candidate solutions. Improved aerodynamic performances have been obtained using this concurrent coupled method, in comparison to a sequential aerodynamic and structural optimization.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design, optimization, realization and testing of a novel wing morphing concept, based on distributed compliance structures, and actuated by piezoelectric elements. The adaptive wing features ribs with a selectively compliant inner structure, numerically optimized to achieve aerodynamically efficient shape changes while simultaneously withstanding aeroelastic loads. The static and dynamic aeroelastic behavior of the wing, and the effect of activating the actuators, is assessed by means of coupled 3D aerodynamic and structural simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed morphing concept and optimization procedure, the wings of a model airplane are designed and manufactured according to the presented approach. The goal is to replace conventional ailerons, thus to achieve controllability in roll purely by morphing. The mechanical properties of the manufactured components are characterized experimentally, and used to create a refined and correlated finite element model. The overall stiffness, strength, and actuation capabilities are experimentally tested and successfully compared with the numerical prediction. To counteract the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the piezoelectric actuators, a closed-loop controller is implemented, and its capability of accurately achieving the desired shape adaptation is evaluated experimentally. Using the correlated finite element model, the aeroelastic behavior of the manufactured wing is simulated, showing that the morphing concept can provide sufficient roll authority to allow controllability of the flight. The additional degrees of freedom offered by morphing can be also used to vary the plane lift coefficient, similarly to conventional flaps. The efficiency improvements offered by this technique are evaluated numerically, and compared to the performance of a rigid wing.},

We develop a simplified and generalized formulation of contact-invariant optimization that enables continuous optimization over contact timings. This formulation is applied to a fully physical humanoid model whose lower limbs are actuated by musculotendon units. Our approach does not rely on prior motion data or on task-specific controllers. Motion is synthesized from first principles, given only a detailed physical model of the body and spacetime constraints. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of activities, such as walking, running, jumping, and kicking. Our approach produces walking motions that quantitatively match ground-truth data, and predicts aspects of human gait initiation, incline walking, and locomotion in reduced gravity.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of surrounding boundaries on the free vibration response of fully and partially submerged cantilevered composite plates and how these effects change due to material anisotropy. The results show that added mass significantly reduces the natural frequencies of cantilevered marine structures as a function of relative submergence depth, more so for composite plates than for steel plates because of the much lower ratio of effective structural mass to hydrodynamic added mass. Added mass effects are most dramatic for partially submerged plates as the plates move from being above to completely beneath the free surface. Free surface effects are shown to become negligible for a fully submerged plate parallel to the free surface when the depth of submergence exceeds 50% of the plate length. Solid boundaries are found to have limited effects for fully-submerged plates near a wall, where maximum decreases in resonance frequencies due to increases in added mass are only a few percent.},

 abstract = {Kriging models have been widely used in computer experiments for the analysis of time-consuming computer codes. Based on kernels, they are flexible and can be tuned to many situations. In this paper, we construct kernels that reproduce the computer code complexity by mimicking its interaction structure. While the standard tensor-product kernel implicitly assumes that all interactions are active, the new kernels are suited for a general interaction structure, and will take advantage of the absence of interaction between some inputs. The methodology is twofold. First, the interaction structure is estimated from the data, using a first initial standard Kriging model, and represented by a so-called FANOVA graph. New FANOVA-based sensitivity indices are introduced to detect active interactions. Then this graph is used to derive the form of the kernel, and the corresponding Kriging model is estimated by maximum likelihood. The performance of the overall procedure is illustrated by several 3-dimensional and 6-dimensional simulated and real examples. A substantial improvement is observed when the computer code has a relatively high level of complexity.},

@article{Mulder1985a,
 abstract = {A number of implicit integration schemes for the one-dimensional Euler equations with conservative upwind spatial differencing are tested on a problem of steady discontinuous flow. Fastest convergence (quadratic for the first-order ``backward Euler'' scheme) is obtained with the upwind switching provided by van Leer's differentiable split fluxes, which easily linearize in time. With Roe's nondifferentiable split flux-differences the iterations may get trapped in a limit-cycle. This also happens in a second-order scheme with split fluxes, if the matrix coefficients arising in the implicit time-linearization are not properly centered in space. The use of second-order terms computed from split fluxes degrades the accuracy of the solution, especially if these are subjected to a limiter for the sake of monotonicity preservation. Second-order terms computed from the characteristic variables perform best.},

@article{Munson2007,
 abstract = {Meshes containing elements with bad quality can result in poorly conditioned
systems of equations that must be solved when using a discretization
method, such as the finite-element method, for solving a partial
differential equation. Moreover, such meshes can lead to poor accuracy
in the approximate solution computed. In this paper, we present a
nonlinear fractional program that relocates the vertex coordinates
of a given mesh to optimize the average element shape quality as
measured by the inverse mean-ratio metric. To solve the resulting
large-scale optimization problems, we apply an efficient implementation
of an inexact Newton algorithm that uses the conjugate gradient method
with a block Jacobi preconditioner to compute the direction. We show
that the block Jacobi preconditioner is positive definite by proving
a general theorem concerning the convexity of fractional functions,
applying this result to components of the inverse mean-ratio metric,
and showing that each block in the preconditioner is invertible.
Numerical results obtained with this special-purpose code on several
test meshes are presented and used to quantify the impact on solution
time and memory requirements of using a modeling language and general-purpose
algorithm to solve these problems.},

@article{Na2017,
 abstract = {Optimization for process design in the chemical engineering industry has been important for energy efficiency and economic feasibility. Because many industries perform optimization with a commercial process simulator such as the Aspen HYSYS, an optimization methodology for expensive black-box functions is needed. Thus, the development of derivative free optimization algorithms has long been studied and the deterministic global search algorithm DIRECT (DIviding a hyper-RECTangle) was suggested. In this paper, a modified DIRECT algorithm with a sub-dividing step for considering hidden constraints is proposed. The effectiveness of the algorithm is exemplified by its application to a cryogenic mixed refrigerant process using a single mixed refrigerant for natural gas liquefaction and its comparison with a well-known stochastic algorithm (GA, PSO, SA), and model based search algorithm (SNOBFIT), local solver (GPS, GSS, MADS, active-set, interior-point, SQP), and other hidden constraint handling methods, including the barrier approach and the neighborhood assignment strategy. Optimal solution calculated by the proposed algorithms decreases the specific power required for natural gas liquefaction to 18.9\% compared to the base case.},

@article{Nastase2006a,
 abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate and develop a fast and robust algorithm for the solution of high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of non-linear systems of conservation laws on unstructured grids. Herein we present the development of a spectral hp-multigrid method, where the coarse ``grid'' levels are constructed by reducing the order (p) of approximation of the discretization using hierarchical basis functions (p-multigrid), together with the traditional (h-multigrid) approach of constructing coarser grids with fewer elements. On each level we employ variants of the element-Jacobi scheme, where the Jacobian entries associated with each element are treated implicitly (i.e., inverted directly) and all other entries are treated explicitly. The methodology is developed for the two-dimensional non-linear Euler equations on unstructured grids, using both non-linear (FAS) and linear (CGC) multigrid schemes. Results are presented for the channel flow over a bump and a uniform flow over a four element airfoil. Current results demonstrate convergence rates which are independent of both order of accuracy (p) of the discretization and level of mesh resolution (h).},

@article{Obayashi1997a,
 abstract = {AERODYNAMIC shape optimization is one of the major research$\backslash$nareas of the present computational ¯ uid dynamics$\backslash$ncommunity.1 Althoughvarioustechniqueshavebeenpresented,they$\backslash$nhave usually concentrated on how the existing optimization algorithms$\backslash$nare appliedto aerodynamicproblems.There were few papers$\backslash$nthat assessed performance of the optimization algorithms for aerodynamic$\backslash$nproblems.$\backslash$nIn this Note, three different optimization algorithms are applied$\backslash$nto airfoil design. A simpli{\textregistered} ed test problem is considered here so$\backslash$nthat the distributionof the objective function can be plotted.The visualization$\backslash$nof the objective function will reveal which optimization$\backslash$nstrategy is preferable. The results of three optimization algorithms$\backslash$nwill be easy to compare and to evaluate as to performance.$\backslash$nOne of the three algorithms employed here is the gradient-based$\backslash$nmethod (GM).2 In this method, the design is updated iteratively in$\backslash$nthe direction of the steepest ascent from the initial design (the hillclimbing$\backslash$nstrategy). Many variations of GM have been used widely$\backslash$ninasmuch as the optimum obtained from GM is a global optimum$\backslash$nif the objective and constraints are differentiable and convex.2 In$\backslash$npractice, however, it is very dif{\textregistered} cult to prove these properties. One$\backslash$ncould only hope for a local optimum in the neighborhood of the$\backslash$ninitial point, provided that the gradient is well de{\textregistered} ned. Therefore,$\backslash$none must start the design from various initial points to determine$\backslash$nif a consistent optimum can be obtained while having reasonable$\backslash$nassurance that this is the true optimum.$\backslash$nThe second is the method of simulated annealing (SA).3 SA is a$\backslash$nheuristic strategy for obtaining near-optimal solutions and derives$\backslash$nits name froman analogyto the annealingof solids.Basically, in this$\backslash$nmethod, the design is updated if a randomly disturbed one is better.$\backslash$nThis strategy is still hill climbing, and it could end up with local$\backslash$nextrema easily as GM does. Thus, SA also accepts a poorer design$\backslash$nwith certain probability related to the Boltzmann distributionunder$\backslash$nthe speci{\textregistered} ed annealingschedule.Therefore,there is a corresponding$\backslash$nchance for the designto get out of a local extreme in favor of {\textregistered} nding$\backslash$na better,more global one.$\backslash$nThe last of the three is genetic algorithm (GA).4 GA is a search$\backslash$nalgorithm based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural$\backslash$ngenetics.GA searches an optimumthrough simulated evolution.$\backslash$nDuring evolution, genotypes (design variables) producing phenotypes$\backslash$n(designs) of increasing biological {\textregistered} tness (objective function)$\backslash$nPresented as Paper 96-2394 at the 14th AIAA Applied Aerodynamics$\backslash$nConference, New Orleans, LA, June 17$\pm$20, 1996; received Aug. 29, 1996;$\backslash$nrevision received April 14, 1997; accepted for publication April 23, 1997.$\backslash$nCopyright c $\,^{\circ}$ 1997 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,$\backslash$nInc.

The combination of mutation and$\backslash$nrecombination, in principle, allows for leaving a smaller hill and,$\backslash$ntherefore, prevents evolution from getting stuck on local extrema.$\backslash$nRecently, GA has attracted attention as a robust optimization$\backslash$ntool.5,6 However, because GA requires a large number of function$\backslash$nevaluations, one might question why GA is preferred against other$\backslash$nmethods.The aimof this Note is to answer this question and demonstrate$\backslash$nGA' s ability using a simpli{\textregistered} ed optimization problem.},

 abstract = {We propose a robust structural optimization of a plate wing that considers the bifurcation in higher mode flutter, which affects the robustness of an optimum design and the convergence of an optimization. In the optimization, the thickness distribution of a delta wing is considered to improve the critical dynamic pressure of supersonic flutter under the constant total mass. The convergence is improved by detaching the distance of eigenvalues between adjacent modes by the positive constant value in the optimization. Consequently, the critical dynamic pressure of the optimum design is six times larger than that of the uniform design. Moreover, to improve the robustness, the constraints are proposed to keep eigenvalues between adjacent modes apart by the specified distance which is composed of the sensitivity of the distance of eigenvalues. Numerical results indicate that the robustness of the optimum design is quantitatively obtained with the constraints.},

@article{Osusky2013a,
 abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a spatial discretization based on summation-by-parts operators with simultaneous approximation terms in combination with a parallel Newton--Krylov--Schur algorithm for solving the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations coupled with the Spalart--Allmaras one-equation turbulence model. The algorithm employs second-order summation-by-parts operators on multiblock structured grids with simultaneous approximation terms to enforce block interface coupling and boundary conditions. The discrete equations are solved iteratively with an inexact-Newton method, while the linear system at each Newton iteration is solved using a flexible Krylov subspace iterative method with an approximate-Schur parallel preconditioner. The algorithm is verified and validated through the solution of two-dimensional model problems, highlighting the correspondence of the current algorithm with several established flow solvers. A transonic solution over the ONERA M6 wing on a mesh with 15.1 million nodes shows good agreement with experiment. Using 128 processors, the residual is reduced by 12 orders of magnitude in 86 min. The solution of transonic flow over the common research model wing--body geometry exhibits the expected grid convergence behavior. The algorithm performs well in solving flows around nonplanar geometries and flows with explicitly specified laminar-to-turbulent transition locations. Parallel scaling studies highlight the excellent scaling characteristics of the algorithm on cases with up to 6656 processors and grids with over 150 million nodes.},

@article{PAPANIKOS2003,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT A progressive fatigue damage model has been developed for predicting damage accumulation and life of carbon fibre{\^a}reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates with arbitrary geometry and stacking sequence subjected to constant amplitude cyclic loading. The model comprises the components of stress analysis, fatigue failure analysis and fatigue material property degradation. Stress analysis of the composite laminate was performed by creating a three{\^a}dimensional finite element model in the ANSYS FE code. Fatigue failure analysis was performed by using a set of Hashin{\^a}type failure criteria and the Ye{\^a}delamination criterion. Two types of material property degradations on the basis of element stiffness and strength were applied: a sudden degradation because of sudden failure detected by the fatigue failure criteria and a gradual degradation because of the nature of cyclic loading, which is driven by the increased number of cycles. The gradual degradation of the composite material was modelled by using functions relating the residual stiffness and residual strength of the laminate to the number of cycles. All model components have been programmed in the ANSYS FE code in order to create a user{\^a}friendly macro{\^a}routine. The model has been applied in two different quasi{\^a}isotropic CFRP laminates subjected to tension{\^a}compression (T{\^a}C) fatigue and the predictions of fatigue life and damage accumulation as a function of the number of cycles were compared with experimental data available in the literature. A very good agreement was obtained.},

In this paper, a globally-biased simplicial partition Disimpl algorithm for global optimization of expensive Lipschitz continuous functions with an unknown Lipschitz constant is proposed. A scheme for an adaptive balancing of local and global information during the search is introduced, implemented, experimentally investigated, and compared with the well-known Direct and Directl methods. Extensive numerical experiments executed on 800 multidimensional multiextremal test functions show a promising performance of the new acceleration technique with respect to competitors.},

@article{Paulavicius2018,
 abstract = {We consider a global optimization problem for Lipschitz-continuous functions with an unknown Lipschitz constant. Our approach is based on the well-known DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles) algorithm and motivated by the diagonal partitioning strategy. One of the main advantages of the diagonal partitioning scheme is that the objective function is evaluated at two points at each hyper-rectangle and, therefore, more comprehensive information about the objective function is considered than using the central sampling strategy used in most DIRECT-type algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new DIRECT-type algorithm, which we call BIRECT (BIsecting RECTangles). In this algorithm, a bisection is used instead of a trisection which is typical for diagonal-based and DIRECT-type algorithms. The bisection is preferable to the trisection because of the shapes of hyper-rectangles, but usual evaluation of the objective function at the center or at the endpoints of the diagonal are not favorable for bisection. In the proposed algorithm the objective function is evaluated at two points on the diagonal equidistant between themselves and the endpoints of a diagonal. This sampling strategy enables reuse of the sampling points in descendant hyper-rectangles. The developed algorithm gives very competitive numerical results compared to the DIRECT algorithm and its well know modifications.},

 abstract = {In this paper, black-box global optimization problem with expensive function evaluations is considered. This problem is challenging for numerical methods due to the practical limits on computational budget often required by intelligent systems. For its efficient solution, a new DIRECT-type hybrid technique is proposed. The new algorithm incorporates a novel sampling on diagonals and bisection strategy (instead of a trisection which is commonly used in the existing DIRECT-type algorithms), embedded into the globally-biased framework, and enriched with three different local minimization strategies. The numerical results on a test set of almost 900 problems from the literature and on a real-life application regarding nonlinear regression show that the new approach effectively addresses well-known DIRECT weaknesses, has beneficial effects on the overall performance, and on average, gives significantly better results compared to several DIRECT-type methods widely used in decision-making expert systems.},

The resulting linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES iterative algorithm. We consider several existing preconditioners such as block Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel combined with multilevel schemes which have been developed and tested for specific applications. While our results are consistent with the claims reported, we find that these preconditioners lack robustness when used in more challenging situations involving low Mach numbers, stretched grids, or high Reynolds number turbulent flows. We propose a preconditioner based on a coarse scale correction with postsmoothing based on a block incomplete LU factorization with zero fill-in (ILU0) of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the ILU0 smoother is found to depend critically on the element numbering. We propose a numbering strategy based on minimizing the discarded fill-in in a greedy fashion. The coarse scale correction scheme is found to be important for diffusion dominated problems, whereas the ILU0 preconditioner with the proposed ordering is effective at handling the convection dominated case. While little can be said in the way of theoretical results, the proposed preconditioner is shown to perform remarkably well for a broad range of representative test problems. These include compressible flows ranging from very low Reynolds numbers to fully turbulent flows using the Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes equations discretized on highly stretched grids. For low Mach number flows, the proposed preconditioner is more than one order of magnitude more efficient than the other preconditioners considered.},

An optimization platform coupled with CFD is used to optimize the propeller. The geometries are automatically meshed in ICEMCFD, and each case is sent to ANSYS CFX for CFD computations. Figure 2 illustrates the process. The CFD results of the studies are analyzed using a wake analysis method. The wake analysis method quantifies the wake structures in terms of engine power, allowing different types of propeller to be analyzed and their losses compared on equal terms. The change in the energy flow passing through the propeller disk area is related to the work added to the flow. The kinetic energy is breakdown into entropy lost work, reversible pressure changes, and kinetic and turbulent energy changes.},

 abstract = {This paper contains an outline of an engineering approach to multi-disciplinary design
optimization and an application of it to a business jet. One of the most challenging issues in
multi-disciplinary optimization is to bring together technologies and methodologies of
various disciplines in a way that is both practical and inclusive of the expertise that must
accompany these individual technologies. The approach taken by the Advanced
Aerodynamics Department at Bombardier Aerospace is to build each component of the
methodology in a stepwise fashion from the ground up and integrate the engineering analysis
and design tools already in place at Bombardier. The methodology is based on the
integration of low and high fidelity computational fluid dynamics codes into the multidisciplinary
environment, the development of conceptual wing structural design codes, wing
weight estimation codes, En Route fuel burn prediction models and codes for the prediction
of wing static aeroelastic deformation under load. Once a multi-disciplinary optimum design
is obtained using low fidelity codes, this preliminary design undergoes a second refinement
stage of optimization using high fidelity codes.},

 abstract = {We present the black hole accretion code (BHAC), a new multidimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics module for the
MPI-AMRVAC framework [1, 2]. BHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh refinement techniques with an efficient block-based approach. Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.},

 abstract = {An iterative algorithm is proposed for nonlinearly constrained optimization calculations when there are no derivatives. Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

@techreport{Pratt1954,
 abstract = {A revised gust-load formula with a new gust factor is derived to replace the gust-load formula and alleviation factor widely used in gust studies. The revised formula utilizes the same principles and retains the same simple form of the original formula but provides a more appropriate and acceptable basis for gust-load calculations. The gust factor is calculated on the basis of a one-minus-cosine gust shape and is presented as a function of a mass-ratio parameter in contrast to the ramp gust shape and wing loading, respectively, used for the alleviation factor. A summary of gust-velocity data from v-g records taken on civil transport airplanes from 1933 to 1950, reevaluated by the revised formula, is also presented.},

It can find the basins of attraction for global or local optima efficiently, especially when dimension is small. Recently, we have proposed a class of modified DIRECT algorithms to eliminate the sensitivities of the original DIRECT to linear scaling of the objective function. In this paper, we devote to find a specific algorithm with best performance among this class. We compare the performance of the modified DIRECT algorithms on the GKLS test set. Numerical results show that DIRECT-median performs outstanding among this class. What is more, numerical results also show that DIRECT-median can find solutions with high accuracy much more efficiently than the original DIRECT.},

@article{Queipo2005a,
 abstract = {A major challenge to the successful full-scale development of modern aerospace systems is to address competing objectives such as improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Accurate, high-fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive. Furthermore, informed decisions should be made with an understanding of the impact (global sensitivity) of the design variables on the different objectives. In this context, the so-called surrogate-based approach for analysis and optimization can play a very valuable role. The surrogates are constructed using data drawn from high-fidelity models, and provide fast approximations of the objectives and constraints at new design points, thereby making sensitivity and optimization studies feasible. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO), highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as practical implications. The issues addressed include the selection of the loss function and regularization criteria for constructing the surrogates, design of experiments, surrogate selection and construction, sensitivity analysis, convergence, and optimization. The multi-objective optimal design of a liquid rocket injector is presented to highlight the state of the art and to help guide future efforts.},

The study shows that this method is a factor of 50 faster than an explicit method that employs local time-stepping to accelerate convergence to steady-state solution. Procedures using LU-SGS preconditioner appear to provide the best performance. The two-level procedure is found necessary for relatively fast convergence in the case of large numbers of mesh elements.},

@article{Raspanti:2000:NSF,
 abstract = {Process flexibility and design under
uncertainty have been researched extensively in the literature. Problem
formulations for flexibility include nested optimization problems and
these can often be refined by substituting the optimality conditions
for these nested problems. However, these reformulations are highly
constrained and can be expensive to solve. In this paper we extend
algorithms to solve these reformulated NLP problem under uncertainty by
introducing two contributions to this approach. These are the use
of a Constraint Aggregation function (KS function) and Smoothing
Functions. We begin with basic properties of KS function. Next, we
review a class of parametric smooth functions, used to replace the
complementarity conditions of the KKT conditions with a well-behaved, smoothed
nonlinear equality constraint. In this paper we apply the previous
strategies to two specific problems: i) the?worst case algorithm?, that
assesses design under uncertainty and, ii) the flexibility index and
feasibility test formulations. In the first case, two new algorithms
are derived, one of them being single level optimization problem.
Next using similar ideas, both flexibility index and feasibility
test are reformulated leading to a single non linear programming
problem instead of a mixed integer non linear programming one. The new
formulations are demonstrated on five different example problems
where a CPU time reduction of more than 70 and 80{\%} is demonstrated.},

@article{Renac2012a,
 abstract = {An efficient and robust time integration procedure for a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method is introduced for solving nonlinear second-order partial differential equations. The time discretization is based on an explicit formulation for the hyperbolic term and an implicit formulation for the parabolic term. The procedure uses an iterative algorithm with reduced evaluation cost. The size of the linear system to be solved is greatly reduced thanks to partial uncoupling in space between low-order and high-order degrees of freedom. Numerical examples are presented for the nonlinear convection-diffusion equation in one and two dimensions including steady and unsteady flow problems. The performance of the present method is investigated in terms of CPU time and compared to a fully implicit method. A von Neumann stability analysis is carried out in order to determine the stability and damping properties of the method. Besides a fairly reduced CPU effort, numerical results demonstrate better convergence properties of the present algorithm when compared to the fully implicit method.},

 abstract = {We present an efficient and easy to implement approach to solving the semidiscrete equation systems resulting from time discretization of nonlinear parabolic problems with discontinuous Galerkin methods of order 𝑟rr. It is based on applying Newton's method and decoupling the Newton update equation, which consists of a coupled system of 𝑟+1r+1r+1 elliptic problems. In order to avoid complex coefficients which arise inevitably in the equations obtained by a direct decoupling, we decouple not the exact Newton update equation but a suitable approximation. The resulting solution scheme is shown to possess fast linear convergence and consists of several steps with same structure as implicit Euler steps. We construct concrete realizations for order one to three and give numerical evidence that the required computing time is reduced significantly compared to assembling and solving the complete coupled system by Newton's method.},

 abstract = {The accuracy of many schemes for interpolating scattered data with radial basis functions depends on a shape parameter c of the radial basis function. In this paper we study the effect of c on the quality of fit of the multiquadric, inverse multiquadric and Gaussian interpolants. We show, numerically, that the value of the optimal c (the value of c that minimizes the interpolation error) depends on the number and distribution of data points, on the data vector, and on the precision of the computation. We present an algorithm for selecting a good value for c that implicitly takes all the above considerations into account. The algorithm selects c by minimizing a cost function that imitates the error between the radial interpolant and the (unknown) function from which the data vector was sampled. The cost function is defined by taking some norm of the error vector E = (E1, ... , EN)T where Ek = Ek = fk - Sk xk) and Sk is the interpolant to a reduced data set obtained by removing the point xk and the corresponding data value fk from the original data set. The cost function can be defined for any radial basis function and any dimension. We present the results of many numerical experiments involving interpolation of two dimensional data sets by the multiquadric, inverse multiquadric and Gaussian interpolants and we show that our algorithm consistently produces good values for the parameter c.},

 abstract = {A borehole temperature record from the Mill Is- land (East Antarctica) icecap reveals a large surface warm- ing signal manifested as a 0.75 K temperature difference over the approximate 100m depth in the zone of zero annual amplitude below the seasonally varying zone. The temper- ature profile shows a break in gradient around 49 m depth, which we model with inverse numerical simulations, indicat- ing that surface warming started around the austral summer of 1980/81 AD $\pm$5 yr. This warming of approximately 0.37 K per decade is consistent with trends seen in both instrumen- tal and other reconstructions for Antarctica and, therefore, suggests that regional- rather than local-scale processes are largely responsible. Alteration of the surface energy budget arising from changes in radiation balances due to local cloud, the amount of liquid deposition and local air temperatures as- sociated with altered air/sea exchanges also potentially plays a role at this location due to the proximity of the Shackleton Ice Shelf and sea-ice zone.},

@article{Robitaille2015,
 abstract = {This paper examines the design of adaptive laminar airfoils in the transonic flow regime using the γ-Re˜θt model as a transition prediction method. A robust solution procedure for the transition model is described and a grid convergence study is presented. Predictions from the model are then compared to an extensive set of experimental results containing transition measurements on a morphing airfoil. It is shown that the sensitivity of the γ-Re˜θt transition model with respect to shape variations allows its use in a design framework. Using a multi-point optimization strategy, the model is then used to design transonic airfoils suitable for a range of flow conditions. The potential improvement in drag associated with the implementation of adaptive airfoil technology is then carefully quantified using single-point optimization with the multi-point designed airfoil as a reference. Structural design constraints are taken into account to obtain a realistic estimate of possible drag reduction through airfoil morphing using current wing construction technology. Airfoil drag improvements of up to 4.6% are obtained through morphing of the section of upper surface located between the wing spars with respect to the baseline multi-point design in flow conditions typical of large business jet operation.},

Despite its acceptance as a design tool, however, structural optimization seems yet to gain mainstream popularity in industry. To remedy this situation, this paper reviews past literatures on structural optimization with emphasis on their relation to mechanical product development, and discusses open research issues that would further enhance the industry acceptance of structural optimization. The past literatures are categorized based on their major research focuses: geometry parameterization, approximation methods, optimization algorithms, and the integration with nonstructural issues. Open problems in each category and anticipated future trends briefly are discussed.}},

@article{Sala:2006:OOF,
 abstract = {We present the design of a high-performance, object oriented framework that
enables the rapid development and usage of efficient, scalable and portable
implementations of multilevel preconditioners for distributed sparse real
matrices, in both serial and (massively) parallel environments. The main
feature of the proposed framework is the use of several programming paradigms
for the diffierent implementation layers, with a strong emphasis on object
oriented classes and operator overloading for the top layer, and optimized
FORTRAN and C code for the layers underneath. We describe an implementation
of the proposed framework, based on the ML library, the algebraic multilevel
preconditioning package of Trilinos, which supports state-of-the-art parallel
smoothed aggregation methods, and can be used to define general algebraic and
geometric multilevel and multigrid preconditioners and solvers. The paper
demonstrates that one can take advantage of object-oriented programming and
operator overloading to obtain intuitive, easy-to-read and easy-to-develop
codes, that are at the same time efficient and scalable. Several numerical
experiments, obtained on serial and parallel computers, show that the overhead
required by the object-oriented layer is very modest, therefore allowing
developers to focus on the new algorithms they are developing and testing,
rather than on the implementation details.},

 abstract = {Synthesis has been defined as the rational directed evolu- tion of
a system configuration which, in terms of a defined criterion, efficiently
performs a set of specified functional purposes. This document presents
the application of the syn- thesis concept to a system with an aeroelastic
technology, Specifically, the system is a hollow symmetric double
wedge air- foil. There are two design variables; airfoil thickness
and chord length. Behavior constraints are root angle of attack,
tip deflection, flutter Mach number, and root stress. Side constraints
of the design parameters are provided. The basic criterion function
is the total energy required to drive the airfoil through a sequence
of flight conditions. Trade off of weight versus energy is studied
using airfoil weight as an additional behavior constraint. The gradient
steep-descent alternate step synthesis method is used. Numerical
results of three example syntheses and a trade-off study are included.
The results indicate that the synthesis concept may be applied successfully
to an aeroelastic system. The study should be extended to consider
the system as a plate structure rather than assuming beam type structural
action.},

@article{Schnell2019a,
 abstract = {In this paper, a turbo-electric propulsion system was analyzed, and its performance was assessed. The aircraft considered here was a single-aisle, medium-range configuration targeting a capacity of 150 Pax. The propulsion concept comprised two boosted geared turbofan engines mounted under-wing. Those main engines were supported by an electrically driven aft-propulsor contributing to the thrust generation and by taking advantage of ingesting the boundary layer of the fuselage for potentially higher levels of propulsive efficiency and allowing for the improved operation of the main engines. The performance assessment as carried out in the context of this paper involved different levels: Firstly, based on the reference aircraft and the detailed description of its major components, the engine performance model for both main engines, as well as for the electrically driven aft-propulsor was set up. The methodology, as introduced, has already been applied in the context of hybrid-electric propulsion and allowed for the aforementioned aircraft sizing, as well as the subsequent gas turbine multi-point synthesis (simulation). A geared turbofan architecture with 2035 technology assumptions was considered for the main engine configuration. The present trade study focused on the design and performance analysis of the aft-propulsor and how it affected the performance of the main engines, due to the electric power generation. In order to allow for a more accurate description of the performance of this particular module, the enhanced streamline curvature method with an underlying and pre-optimized profile database was used to design a propulsor tailored to meet the requirements of the aft propulsor as derived from the cycle synthesis and overall aircraft specification; existing design expertise for novel and highly integrated propulsors could be taken advantage of herein. The resulting performance characteristics from the streamline curvature method were then fed back to the engine performance model in a closely coupled approach in order to have a more accurate description of the module behavior. This direct coupling allowed for enhanced sensitivity studies, monitoring different top-level parameters, such as the thrust/power split between the main engines and the aft propulsor. As a result, different propulsor specifications and fan designs with optimal performance characteristics were achieved, which in return affected the performance of all subsystems considered.},

@article{Schonlau1998,
 abstract = {Engineering systems are now frequently optimized via computer models. The input-output relationships in these models are often highly nonlinear deterministic functions that are expensive to compute. Thus, when searching for the global optimum, it is desirable to minimize the number of function evaluations. Bayesian global optimization methods are well-suited to this task because they make use of all previous evaluations in selecting the next search point. A statistical model is fit to the sampled points which allows predictions to be made elsewhere, along with a measure of possible prediction error (uncertainty). The next point is chosen to maximize a criterion that balances searching where the predicted value of the function is good (local search) with searching where the uncertainty of prediction is large (global search). We extend this methodology in several ways. First, we introduce a parameter that controls the local-global balance. Secondly, we propose a method for dealing with nonlinear inequality constraints from additional response variables. Lastly, we adapt the sequential algorithm to proceed in stages rather than one point at a time. The extensions are illustrated using a shape optimization problem from the automotive industry.},

@inbook{Schulz2013,
 abstract = {Recently, optimization has become an integral part of the aerodynamic design process chain. However, because of uncertainties with respect to the flight conditions and geometry uncertainties, a design optimized by a traditional design optimization method seeking only optimality may not achieve its expected performance. Robust optimization deals with optimal designs, which are robust with respect to small (or even large) perturbations of the optimization setpoint conditions. That means, the optimal designs computed should still be good designs, even if the input parameters for the optimization problem formulation are changed by a non-negligible amount. Thus even more experimental or numerical effort can be saved. In this paper, we aim at an improvement of existing simulation and optimization technology, developed in the German collaborative effort MEGADESIGN1, so that numerical uncertainties are identified, quantized and included in the overall optimization procedure, thus making robust design in this sense possible. We introduce two robust formulations of the aerodynamic optimization problem which we numerically compare in a 2d testcase under uncertain flight conditions. Beside the scalar valued uncertainties we consider the shape itself as an uncertainty source and apply a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion to approximate the infinite-dimensional probability space. To overcome the curse of dimensionality an adaptively refined sparse grid is used in order to compute statistics of the solution.},

@article{Schutte2004a,
 abstract = {Abstract Present day engineering optimization problems often impose large computational demands, resulting in long solution times even on a modern high-end processor. To obtain enhanced computational throughput and global search capability, we detail the coarse-grained parallelization of an increasingly popular global search method, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Parallel PSO performance was evaluated using two categories of optimization problems possessing multiple local minima---large-scale analytical test problems with computationally cheap function evaluations and medium-scale biomechanical system identification problems with computationally expensive function evaluations. For load-balanced analytical test problems formulated using 128 design variables, speedup was close to ideal and parallel efficiency above 95\% for up to 32 nodes on a Beowulf cluster. In contrast, for load-imbalanced biomechanical system identification problems with 12 design variables, speedup plateaued and parallel efficiency decreased almost linearly with increasing number of nodes. The primary factor affecting parallel performance was the synchronization requirement of the parallel algorithm, which dictated that each iteration must wait for completion of the slowest fitness evaluation. When the analytical problems were solved using a fixed number of swarm iterations, a single population of 128 particles produced a better convergence rate than did multiple independent runs performed using sub-populations (8 runs with 16 particles, 4 runs with 32 particles, or 2 runs with 64 particles). These results suggest that (1) parallel PSO exhibits excellent parallel performance under load-balanced conditions, (2) an asynchronous implementation would be valuable for real-life problems subject to load imbalance, and (3) larger population sizes should be considered when multiple processors are available.

@article{Secco2021a,
 abstract = {Mesh generation and deformation are critical elements in gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO). Improperly generated or deformed meshes may contain bad-quality cells that degrade the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Moreover, an inefficient mesh deformation method can become the bottleneck for the entire ASO process. To perform practical ASO, mesh generation and deformation methods need to be automated, scalable, robust, and computationally efficient. This paper tackles these challenges by developing an efficient approach for generating high-quality structured meshes in a semi-automatic manner. An automatic mesh generation approach is also proposed to handle intersections of multiple structured meshes with the overset mesh approach. In addition to mesh generation, a flexible mesh deformation method is developed, along with an efficient approach for computing mesh deformation derivatives using automatic differentiation. Finally, the performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness. It is demonstrated that the mesh generation approach scales up to 100 million cells and 256~CPU-cores. In addition, the robust mesh deformation approach enables a large range of valid mesh deformations, which gives more freedom to explore the design space in ASO. Moreover, the mesh deformation and the computation of its derivatives require only 0.1 of the CFD runtime. The mesh generation and deformation approaches have been implemented in the pyHyp and IDWarp software packages, which are publicly available under open-source licenses.  The proposed approaches have the potential to become useful tools to handle general ASO problems for aircraft, turbomachinery, and ground vehicles.},

 abstract = {Ensuring the safe operation of new supersonic transport aircraft requires understanding their stability during takeoff and landing. These phases involve flying at subsonic speeds and high angles of attack, where the aerodynamics are characterized by unsteady vortical flow. In this work, we assess the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and delayed detached eddy simulations (DDES) at these flow conditions. We use a delta wing with an aspect ratio of 2 as a simplified representation of a supersonic transport wing and compare the predicted force and moment coefficients to experimental data for angles of attack from 0 to 40 degrees. We formulate a steadiness metric to distinguish between steady and unsteady angles of attack. We find that RANS accurately predicts vortex effects in the steady regime but is inaccurate at high angles of attack where the flow is unsteady. DDES is more reliable in the unsteady regime, but the computational cost is at least 100 times that of RANS. Predicting the pitching moment at the highest angles of attack is difficult even with DDES on a 69 million cell mesh. These results provide guidelines for choosing the appropriate fidelity depending on the flow characteristics, the required accuracy, and the computational budget.},

 abstract = {In this paper new global optimization algorithms are proposed for solving problems where the objective function is univariate and has Lipschitzean first derivatives. To solve this problem, smooth auxiliary functions, which are adaptively improved during the course of the search, are constructed. Three new algorithms are introduced: the first used the exact a priori known Lipschitz constant for derivatives; the second, when this constant is unknown, estimates it during the course of the search and finally, the last method uses neither the exact global Lipschitz constant nor its estimate but instead adaptively estimates the local Lipschitz constants in different sectors of the search region during the course of optimization. Convergence conditions of the methods are investigated from a general viewpoint and some numerical results are also given. {\copyright}1998 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

 abstract = {Global optimization problems where evaluation of the objective function is an expensive operation arise frequently in engineering, decision making, optimal control, etc. There exist two huge but almost completely disjoint communities (they have different journals, different conferences, different test functions, etc.) solving these problems: a broad community of practitioners using stochastic nature-inspired metaheuristics and people from academia studying deterministic mathematical programming methods. In order to bridge the gap between these communities we propose a visual technique for a systematic comparison of global optimization algorithms having different nature. Results of more than 800,000 runs on 800 randomly generated tests show that both stochastic nature-inspired metaheuristics and deterministic global optimization methods are competitive and surpass one another in dependence on the available budget of function evaluations.},

@article{Sergeyev2018i,
 abstract = {The necessity to find the global optimum of multiextremal functions arises in many applied problems where finding local solutions is insufficient. One of the desirable properties of global optimization methods is strong homogeneity meaning that a method produces the same sequences of points where the objective function is evaluated independently both of multiplication of the function by a scaling constant and of adding a shifting constant. In this paper, several aspects of global optimization using strongly homogeneous methods are considered. First, it is shown that even if a method possesses this property theoretically, numerically very small and large scaling constants can lead to ill-conditioning of the scaled problem. Second, a new class of global optimization problems where the objective function can have not only finite but also infinite or infinitesimal Lipschitz constants is introduced. Third, the strong homogeneity of several Lipschitz global optimization algorithms is studied in the framework of the Infinity Computing paradigm allowing one to work numerically with a variety of infinities and infinitesimals. Fourth, it is proved that a class of efficient univariate methods enjoys this property for finite, infinite and infinitesimal scaling and shifting constants. Finally, it is shown that in certain cases the usage of numerical infinities and infinitesimals can avoid ill-conditioning produced by scaling. Numerical experiments illustrating theoretical results are described.},

The application of established, large-scale, optimization algorithms to the complete model is nearly impossible. Hierarchical decompositions are inappropriate for these types of problems and do not parallelize well. Sobieszczanski-Sobieski has proposed a nonhierarchical decomposition strategyfor nonlinear constrained optimization that is naturally parallel. Despite some successes on engineering problems, the algorithm as originally proposed fails on simple two-dimensional quadratic programs. This paper demonstrates the failure of the algorithm for quadratic programs and suggests a number of possible modifications.},

 abstract = {To reduce the computational cost of solving engineering design optimization problems with both expensive objective and constraints, a novel filter-based adaptive Kriging method notated as FLT-AKM is proposed in this paper. In FLT-AKM, a probability of constrained improvement (PCI) criterion is developed based on the notion of filter to sequentially generate new samples for updating Kriging metamodels of objective and constraints. At each iteration, an infill sample point is allocated at the position where the PCI is maximized to achieve potential improvement in optimality and feasibility. And the Kriging metamodels are consecutively updated by the newly-added infill sample points, which leads the FLT-AKM search to rapidly converge to the global optimum. The performance of the proposed FLT-AKM method is tested on a number of numerical benchmark problems via comparing with several widely-used metamodel-based constrained optimization methods. The comparison results indicate that FLT-AKM generally outperforms the competitors in terms of global convergence and efficiency performance. Finally, FLT-AKM is successfully applied to an all-electric GEO satellite MDO problem. The optimization results show that FLT-AKM is able to find a better feasible design with fewer computational budgets compared with our previous study, which demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed FLT-AKM method for solving real-world expensive black-box engineering design optimization problems.},

 abstract = {Natural laminar-flow wings are one of the most promising technologies for reducing fuel burn and emissions for commercial aviation. However, there is a lack of tools for performing shape optimization of wings based on computational fluid dynamics considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. To address this need, we develop a discrete adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled. The core of this framework is a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver that is coupled with a simplified e N method to predict Tollmien--Schlichting and laminar separation-induced transition that consists of a laminar boundary-layer code and a database method for flow stability analysis. The transition prediction is integrated with a Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model through a smoothed intermittency function, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization. A coupled-adjoint approach that uses transpose Jacobian-vector products derived via automatic differentiation computes the transition prediction derivatives. Lift-constrained drag minimizations of airfoils for a single-point design and a multipoint design problem are performed. The results show that the optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by increasing the extent of laminar flow. The multipoint optimization formulation produces an airfoil with a significant amount of laminar flow that is maintained at several flight conditions. The proposed methods make it possible to perform aerodynamic shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition in airfoil optimization.},

@article{Siah_Sasena2004,
 abstract = {With the advent of fast methods to significantly speed up numerical computation of large-scale realistic electromagnetic (EM) structures, EM design and optimization is becoming increasingly attractive. In recent years, genetic algorithms, neural network and evolutionary optimization methods have become increasingly popular for EM optimization. However, these methods are usually associated with a slow convergence bound and, furthermore, may not yield a deterministic optimal solution. In this paper, a new hybrid method using Kriging metamodeling in conjunction with the divided rectangles (DIRECT) global-optimization algorithm is used to yield a globally optimal solution efficiently. The latter yields a deterministic answer with fast convergence bounds and inherits both local and global-optimization properties. Three examples are given to illustrate the applicability of the method, Le., shape optimization for a slot-array frequency-selective surface, antenna location optimization to minimize EM coupling from the antenna to RF devices in automobile structures, and multisensor optimization to satisfy RF coupling constraints on a vehicular chassis in the presence of a wire harness. In the first example, DIRECT with Kriging surrogate modeling was employed. In the latter two examples, the adaptive hybrid optimizer, superEGO, was used. In all three examples, emphasis is placed on the speed of convergence, as well as on the flexibility of the optimization algorithms.},

@article{Spalart2000a,
 abstract = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent flow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate reflection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for bluff-body and similar flows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy demands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid refinement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some approaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very fine; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaffordable. Their empirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are offered of the grid resolution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.},

 abstract = {The Stampede 1 supercomputer was a tremendous success as an XSEDE resource, providing more than eight million successful computational simulations and data analysis jobs to more than ten thousand users. In addition, Stampede 1 introduced new technology that began to move users towards many core processors. As Stampede 1 reaches the end of its production life, it is being replaced in phases by a new supercomputer, Stampede 2, that will not only take up much of the original system's workload, but continue the bridge to technologies on the path to exascale computing. This paper provides a brief summary of the experiences of Stampede 1, and details the design and architecture of Stampede 2. Early results are presented from a subset of Intel Knights Landing nodes that are bridging between the two systems.},

approach the multidisciplinary task of optimizing a tiltrotor wing
structure which is equipped with an active flutter suppression system.
Objective function is a productivity index, as a measure for aircraft
cost-effectiveness. Short digress is held on the characteristics of the tiltrotor's
dynamic system and its aeroelastic behavior. Contributing analyses
(CA's) for calculating aircraft performance, modeling the dynamic
system, and designing an active flutter suppression control system are
selected. Multilevel and non-hierarchic decomposition techniques are
discussed. A file structure for handling data transfer between the
CA's and the optimizer is presented. Preliminary results are shown
which highlight some peculiarities of this optimization problem.},

However, the efficiency of the DIRECT algorithm deteriorates on problems with many local optima and when the solution with high accuracy is required. To overcome these difficulties different regimes of global and local search are introduced or the algorithm is combined with local optimization. In this paper we investigate a different direction of improvement of the DIRECT algorithm and propose a new strategy for the selection of potentially optimal rectangles, what does not require any additional parameters or local search subroutines. An extensive experimental investigation reveals the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements.},

 abstract = {Applied optimization problems often include constraints. Although the well-known derivative-free global-search DIRECT algorithm performs well solving box-constrained global optimization problems, it does not naturally address constraints. In this article, we develop a new algorithm DIRECT-GLce for general constrained global optimization problems incorporating two-step selection procedure and penalty function approach in our recent DIRECT-GL algorithm. The proposed algorithm effectively explores hyper-rectangles with infeasible centers which are close to boundaries of feasibility and may cover feasible regions. An extensive experimental investigation revealed the potential of the proposed approach compared with other existing DIRECT-type algorithms for constrained global optimization problems, including important engineering problems.},

This paper shows how the combination of DIRECT and Nelder-Mead algorithms can improve the efficiency in the parameter tuning of a sheet-metal press line. A combined optimisation algorithm is proposed that determines and utilises all local optimal points from DIRECT algorithm as Nelder-Mead starting points. To reduce the total optimisation time, all Nelder-Mead optimisations can be executed in parallel. Additionally, a Collision Inspection Method is implemented in the simulation model to reduce the evaluation time. Altogether, this results in an industrially useful parameter tuning method. Improvements of an increased production rate of 7% and 40% smoother robot motions have been achieved.},

A vortex lattice method is used to evaluate the performance and the time-dependent pressure distribution on the blade surface in a non-uniform flow, while efficient optimization algorithms are used to modify the blade sections. Two different designs were carried out in this study. The first was a design to realize a target pressure distribution in a rotating three-dimensional flow. A two-dimensional wing theory was used to obtain the target pressure distribution. The predicted increase in efficiency and the reduction in the cavity volume were confirmed by model experiments. The second was a design to maximize the propeller efficiency. By this method, the propeller efficiency was improved by 1.2% under the constrains of constant thrust and a prescribed margin for face cavitation.},

 abstract = {DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) is an efficient and popular method in dealing with bound constrained optimization problems. However, DIRECT suffers from dimension curse, since its computational complexity soars when dimension increases. Besides, DIRECT also converges slowly when the objective function is flat. In this paper, we propose a coordinate DIRECT algorithm, which coincides with the spirits of other coordinate update algorithms. We transform the original problem into a series of sub-problems, where only one or several coordinates are selected to optimize and the rest keeps fixed. For each sub-problem, coordinately dividing the feasible domain enjoys low computational burden. Besides, we develop adaptive schemes to keep the efficiency and flexibility to tackle different functions. Specifically, we use block coordinate update, of which the size could be adaptively selected, and we also employ sequential quadratic programming to conduct the local search to efficiently accelerate the convergence even when the objective function is flat. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm achieves promising performance on both efficiency and accuracy in numerical experiments.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a space mapping algorithm for airfoil shape optimization enhanced with adjoint sensitivities. The surrogate-based algorithm utilizes low-cost derivative information obtained through adjoint sensitivities to improve the space mapping matching between a high-fidelity airfoil model, evaluated through expensive CFD simulations, and its fast surrogate. Here, the airfoil surrogate model is constructed though low-fidelity CFD simulations. As a result, the design process can be performed at a low computational cost in terms of the number of high-fidelity CFD simulations. The adjoint sensitivities are also exploited to speed up the surrogate optimization process. Our method is applied to a constrained drag minimization problem in two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow. The problem is solved for several low-fidelity model termination criteria. The results show that when compared with direct gradient-based optimization with adjoint sensitivities, the proposed approach requires 49-78% less computational cost while still obtaining a comparable airfoil design.},

@article{Thiery2005,
 abstract = {The present article deals with recent numerical results from on-going research conducted at ONERA/DMAE regarding the validation of turbulence models for unsteady transonic flows, in which the mechanism of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction is important. The main goal is to predict the onset and extent of shock induced oscillations (SIO) that appear over the suction side of two-dimensional rigid airfoils and lead to the formation of unsteady separated areas. Computations are performed with the ONERA object-oriented software ``elsA'', using the URANS-type approach. In this approach, the unsteady mean turbulent flow is resolved using the standard Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations and closure relationships involving standard transport equation-type models without any explicit modification due to unsteadiness. Applications are provided and discussed for two different test cases, one of which is rather well documented for CFD validation and described by mean-flow, phase-averaged and fluctuating data. Results demonstrate the importance of modelling the upper and lower walls of the test section when trying to capture SIO as precisely as possible with 2D computations, even though the adaptation of wind tunnel walls had been carefully considered. Finally, turbulence validation has been performed using one- and two-transport equation-type models, one of them resulting from in-house investigations for other turbulent flows applications.},

@article{Thormann2013,
 abstract = {Determining the flutter boundaries for full aircraft configurations by time-accurately solving the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations is prohibitive with respect to computational expense, as the unsteady aerodynamic loading must be predicted for a wide range of flight conditions, frequencies, and structural mode shapes. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to accurately predict flutter boundaries in the viscous transonic regime-a demand, which, until recently, could only be satisfied by high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes methods. Brought to application readiness over the last years, time-linearized/small-disturbance methods, however, have been shown to satisfy this demand as well. They retain the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes method's fidelity to a high degree, at a substantially reduced computational expense. Such a method is presented here on the basis of the TAU-Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes method. Denoted as the TAU linear-frequency-domain method, it is validated for both a standard transonic airfoil and a high-aspect-ratio-wing dynamic test case using rigid pitch modes. The response data obtained from the linear frequency domain are in good agreement with the experiment for a two-dimensional case. For the three-dimensional case, there are larger differences. More important, the linear-frequency-domain method is in excellent agreement to time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Depending on the linearfrequency-domain-employed-solution scheme, reductions in computational costs well beyond an order of magnitude are obtained. In addition, the limits of the so-called frozen-eddy-viscosity approach are established. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

common AD techniques using operator overloading to take advantage
of the fact that in a FEM/FD/FV framework, a limited number of
functions and their partial derivatives with respect to the
unknowns have to be evaluated many times. The extension is
implemented in C++ for both forward and reverse modes, and
compared to hand coded evaluation of derivatives and two

@article{Tiwari2010,
 abstract = {In this paper, a compact packing algorithm for the placement of objects inside a container is described. The proposed packing algorithm is designed to pack three-dimensional free-form objects inside an arbitrary enclosure such that the packing efficiency is maximized. The proposed packing algorithm can handle objects with holes or cavities, and its performance does not degrade significantly with the increase in complexity of the enclosure or the objects. The packing algorithm takes as input the tessellated geometry of the container and all the objects to be packed and outputs the list of objects that can be placed inside the enclosure. The packing algorithm also outputs the location and orientation of all the objects, the packing sequence, and the packed configuration. An improved layout algorithm that works with arbitrary container geometry is also proposed. Separate layout algorithms for the SAE and ISO luggage are developed. Several heuristics to improve the performance of the packing algorithm are also incorporated. Certain aspects that facilitate fast and efficient handling of the computer aided design (CAD) data are also discussed. A comprehensive benchmarking of the proposed packing algorithm on synthetic and hypothetical problems reflects its superior performance as compared with other similar approaches. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of a surface mesh movement algorithm suitable for computer-aided-design-based aerodynamic shape optimization. The algorithm interrogates the computer-aided-design system via the vendor-neutral application programming interface Computational Analysis Programming Interface and uses the Computational Analysis Programming Interface's watertight triangulation of a modified computer-aided-design geometry to guide the movement of the structured surface mesh as the geometry changes during the optimization process. A mapping procedure is introduced that not only preserves the characteristics of the original surface mesh but also guarantees that the new mesh points are on the computer-aided-design geometry. The deformed surface mesh is then smoothed in the parametric space before it is transformed back into three-dimensional space. The procedure is efficient, in that all the processing is done in the parametric space, incurring minimal computational cost. The mesh movement tool is integrated into a three-dimensional shape-optimization framework, with a linear-elasticity volume-mesh movement algorithm, a Newton--Krylov flow solver for the Euler equations, and a discrete-adjoint gradient-based optimizer. The accuracy of the computed gradients is verified through a number of examples.},

 abstract = {Propulsors with boundary layer ingestion (BLI) generate a propulsive force with lower flow power input than conventional engines. This aerodynamic benefit can be traced back to its sources: reductions in jet, surface, and wake dissipation. A framework for BLI analysis is developed based on the power balance method: parametric expressions are derived for the net streamwise force on an aircraft and for the mechanical flow power required, as well as relations for the dissipation components. They illustrate the range of possible comparisons between BLI and non-BLI engine installations, and show how the benefit varies with design choices. Applying the framework to wind tunnel data from powered D8 aircraft model tests, the sources of aerodynamic BLI benefit are quantified for a realistic transport aircraft configuration. With the same propulsors (equal nozzle area) BLI reduces cruise power by 8.2\%, of which 5.2\% comes from a reduction in jet dissipation, 2.4\% from reduced surface dissipation, and 0.6\% from reduced wake dissipation. The jet dissipation reduction is equivalent to a 3.4 percentage points increase in propulsive efficiency. If the installations are compared at equal mass flow, the benefit amounts to a 9\% lower cruise power.},

 abstract = {The Open/ADF tool allows the evaluation of derivatives of functions defined by a Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. Open/ADF has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, Open/ADF uses components provided by the Open/AD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, Open/ADF supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics, a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new decomposition method for solving large scale multiperiod design problems. These problems are formulated as nonlinear optimization problems with a special block angular structure and linking variables. The proposed method, based on successive quadratic program- ming (SOP). uses a decoupling scheme and projects the orignai problem into a quadratic subproblem involving only the complicating variables. Using this subproblem as the main coordination step the problem in the full space is solved as a stream of independent single period problems. The key property of this method is that the computational effort scales linearly to the number of periods compared to a quadratic and cubic increase for general purpose reduced gradient and SUP methods, repectively. To illustrate this property, the method is applied to four example problems including two in multiperiod chemical process design. Its performance is superior to both MINOS and SQP in terms of computational demands, number of function evaluations and solution robustness.},

 abstract = {Surrogate-based optimization proceeds in cycles. Each cycle consists of analyzing a number of designs, fitting a surrogate, performing optimization based on the surrogate, and finally analyzing a candidate solution. Algorithms that use the surrogate uncertainty estimator to guide the selection of the next sampling candidate are readily available, e.g., the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm. However, adding one single point at a time may not be efficient when the main concern is wall-clock time (rather than number of simulations) and simulations can run in parallel. Also, the need for uncertainty estimates limits EGO-like strategies to surrogates normally implemented with such estimates (e.g., kriging and polynomial response surface). We propose the multiple surrogate efficient global optimization (MSEGO) algorithm, which adds several points per optimization cycle with the help of multiple surrogates. We import uncertainty estimates from one surrogate to another to allow use of surrogates that do not provide them. The approach is tested on three analytic examples for nine basic surrogates including kriging, radial basis neural networks, linear Shepard, and six different instances of support vector regression. We found that MSEGO works well even with imported uncertainty estimates, delivering better results in a fraction of the optimization cycles needed by EGO.},

An overview of the different Navier--Stokes codes used in Europe is given, and on-going developments are outlined. The current state of progress is illustrated by computed steady and unsteady solutions to industrial problems, ranging from airfoil characteristics, flow around an isolated wing, to full aircraft configurations. A discussion on the future industrial design environment is given, and developments in Europe towards a more integrated design approach with underlying concepts like `concurrent engineering (CE)' and the `virtual product (VP)' are summarized.

The main contribution of this study to aerodynamic design area is to evaluate the impact of turbulence models and shape parameterization techniques on the computational cost, optimal shape, and its performance obtained with robust optimization under uncertainty. The two turbulence models investigated include Spalart--Allmaras and Menter's shear-stress transport models. Hicks--Henne bump functions, B-spline curves, and free-form deformation are used as shape parameterization techniques. The results of the current study show that the shape parameterization technique has a larger impact on the computational cost compared to the turbulence model in both deterministic and robust design. Robust design tends to reduce the impact of the turbulence model selection on the optimum shape and performance, whereas the turbulence model becomes important for the deterministic design at off-design conditions. In this study, the robustness of the final design obtained with stochastic optimization approach is also demonstrated over the Mach number range considered as the uncertain operating condition. },

 abstract = {Nonlinear programming (NLP) has become an essential tool in process engineering, leading to profit gains through improved plant designs and better control strategies. The rapid advance in computer technology enables engineers to consider increasingly complex systems, where existing optimization codes reach their practical limits. The objective of this dissertation is the design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation of a new NLP algorithm that is able to overcome the current bottlenecks, particularly in the area of process engineering. The proposed algorithm follows an interior point approach, thereby avoiding the combinatorial complexity of identifying the active constraints. Emphasis is laid on flexibility in the computation of search directions, which allows the tailoring of the method to individual applications and is mandatory for the solution of very large problems. In a full-space version the method can be used as general purpose NLP solver, for example in modeling environments such as AMPL. The reduced space version, based on coordinate decomposition, makes it possible to tailor linear algebra work to particular problem structures, such as those arising in dynamic optimization, or even to re-use existing simulation software. If second derivatives are available, they can be exploited explicitly, or otherwise approximated by quasi-Newton methods. In addition, as a compromise between those two options, a conjugate gradient method is implemented for the computation of the tangential step, for which two preconditioners are proposed. This makes the reduced space approach attractive even for problems with many degrees of freedom. Global convergence is enforced by a novel filter line search procedure, which aims to improve efficiency and robustnes over traditional merit function approaches. The discussion of theoretical aspects includes a detailed analysis of a new type of global convergence failure inherent to many current interior point NLP solvers. Global convergence of the filter line search method, introduced to overcome this convergence problem, is proven under mild assumptions. It is further shown that the Maratos effect can be avoided in this framework by second order correction steps, which enables fast local convergence. The practical performance of the proposed method as a general purpose NLP solver is tested on a large variety of NLP test problems. Among the implemented line search methods, the new filter approach seems superior to those based on merit functions. The new optimization code also compares favorably with two other recently developed interior point NLP solvers. The potential of the new method in the area of process engineeing is demonstrated on two dynamic optimization examples with different characteristics, which are solved using orthogonal collocation in a new implementation of the elemental decompositon. Here, the effectiveness of the individual strategies to handle second derivative information is compared. The results confirm that the best choice depends on the particular application. The largest instance addressed is a model with 70 differential and 356 algebraic equations, discretized over 1,500 elements. The resulting NLP with more than 2 million variables and 4,500 degrees of freedom is solved in less than 7 hours on a Linux workstation.},

 abstract = {Line search methods for nonlinear programming using Fletcher and Leyffer's filter method, which replaces the traditional merit function, are proposed and their global and local convergence properties are analyzed. Previous theoretical work on filter methods has considered trust region algorithms and only the question of global convergence. The presented framework is applied to barrier interior point and active set SQP algorithms. Under mild assumptions it is shown that every limit point of the sequence of iterates generated by the algorithm is feasible, and that there exists at least one limit point that is a stationary point for the problem under consideration. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed methods do not suffer from the Maratos effect if the search directions are improved by second order corrections, so that fast local convergence to strict local solutions is achieved. A new alternative filter approach employing the Lagrangian function instead of the objective function with identical global convergence properties is briefly discussed.},

 abstract = {A class of trust-region sequential quadratic programming algorithms for the solution of minimization problems with nonlinear equality constraints is analyzed. The considered class of optimization methods does not require the exact evaluation of the constraint Jacobian in each opti- mization step but uses only an approximation of this first-order derivative information. Hence, the presented approach is especially well suited for equality constrained optimization problems where the Jacobian of the constraints is dense. The accuracy requirements for the presented first-order global convergence result are based on the feasibility and the optimality of the iterates. The corresponding criteria can be verified easily during the optimization process to adjust the approximation quality of the constraint Jacobian.},

It enjoys the flexibility of switch- ing between a line search method that computes steps by factoring the primal-dual equations and a trust region method that uses a conjugate gradient iteration. Steps computed by direct factorization are always tried first, but if they are deemed ineffective, a trust region iteration that guarantees progress toward stationarity is invoked. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the algorithm is implemented in the Knitro [6, 28] software package and is extensively tested on a wide selection of test problems.},

 abstract = {Efficient solution techniques for high-order accurate time-dependent problems are investigated for solving the two-dimensional non-linear Euler equations in this work. The spatial discretization consists of a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach. Implicit time-integration techniques are considered exclusively in order to avoid the stability restrictions of explicit methods. Standard backwards differencing methods (BDF1 and BDF2) as well as a second-order Crank--Nicholson (CN2) and a fourth-order implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK4) scheme are considered in an attempt to balance the spatial and temporal accuracy of the overall approach. The implicit system arising at each time step is solved using a p-multigrid approach, which is shown to produce h independent convergence rates, while remaining relatively insensitive to the time-step size. The Crank--Nicholson methodology, although not L-stable, demonstrates superior performance compared to the BDF2 scheme for the problems chosen in this work. However, the fourth-order accurate implicit Runge--Kutta scheme is found to be the most efficient in terms of computational cost for a given accuracy level as compared to the lower-order schemes, in spite of the added cost per time step, and the benefits of this scheme increase for tighter error tolerances.},

@article{WARD2018,
 abstract = {An inverse method for reconstruction of the in situ steady-state hydrodynamic load distribution using limited strain measurements is developed and validated on a rectangular, flexible surface-piercing hydrofoil in fully-wetted (FW) and fully-ventilated (FV) flows. The hydrofoil is used as a canonical proxy to more complex hydrodynamic lifting surfaces such as marine propulsors and turbines. The approach involves using a forward fluid--structure interaction (FSI) model to predict the hydroelastic response for given operating conditions. The inverse problem is solved as an optimization problem to determine unknown operating conditions. The forward FSI model consists of a nonlinear lifting line (LL) fluid solver with considerations for free surface, ventilation, and viscous effects, and a solid finite element method (FEM) solver using 1-D beam elements representing the spanwise bending and twisting deformations. The coupled FSI model was validated using data collected during towing tank experiments at the University of Michigan. Predictions of the lift and moment coefficients, as well as spanwise bending and twisting deformations agreed well with experimental results in FW and in FV flows. The inverse problem is formulated as an optimization problem to determine the unknown operating conditions that will minimize the difference between the measured and predicted deformations. To avoid non-uniqueness problems often encountered by inverse problems, a dynamic constraint using the measured wetted natural frequencies was added to help regularize the problem and speed up the solution process. A sequential quadratic programming algorithm was used as the optimizer for the inverse problem. The experimental studies showed that the inverse FSI model accurately determined the unknown operating conditions (angle of attack and immersed aspect ratio) for a given a known flow speed and a limited number of strain measurements in both FW and FV conditions. The converged results were used to reconstruct a 3-D hydrodynamic load distribution on the foil and to predict the cavity shape for FV operating conditions, which were found to agree well with experimental measurements and observations.},

As a result, in contrast with previous methods, the sub- problems in the first level include a small number of variables to be adjusted; in addition, the generalized Lagrangian is decomposable in a simple manner. Further, the decomposition is not subject to any restriction, which is often encountered in feasible methods.},

 abstract = {A discrete adjoint method for efficiently computing gradients for aerodynamic shape op- timizations is presented. The chain itself involves an unstructuredmesh Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solver, and is suitable for the optimization of complex geometries in three dimensions. In addition to the discrete flow adjoint the method introduces a second ad- joint equation for the mesh deformation. Using the adjoint chain it is possible to evaluate the gradients of a cost function for the cost of one adjoint flow solution and one adjoint volume mesh deformation, without performing any (forward) mesh deformation. By choos- ing a suitable mesh deformation operator, like linear elasticity, the chain may be readily constructed by hand. Furthermore, this adjoint chain can be subsequently used with pa- rameterized surface grids. The accuracy and the computational savings of the resulting procedure is examined for the gradient-based shape optimization of a wing in inviscid flow.},

@book{Wilcox2006a,
 abstract = {As in the first and second editions, the book revolves around the fact that turbulence modeling is one of three key elements in CFD. Very precise mathematical theories have evolved for the other two, viz., grid generation and algorithm development. By its nature, i.e., creating a mathematical model that approximates the physical behavior of turbulent flows, far less precision has been achieved in turbulence modeling. This text addresses the problem of selecting/devising such models. The fundamental premise is, in the spirit of G. I. Taylor, an ideal model should introduce the minimum amount of complexity while capturing the essence of the relevant physics.  The text begins with the simplest models and charts a course leading to some of the most complex models that have been applied to a nontrivial flow. Along the way, a systematic methodology is presented for developing and analyzing turbulence models. The methodology makes use of tensor calculus, similarity solutions, singular perturbation methods, and numerical procedures. The text stresses the need to achieve a balance amongst the physics of turbulence, mathematical tools required to solve turbulence-model equations, and common numerical problems attending their use (i.e., what good is a model if it makes your program crash?). Several user friendly programs and detailed user's guides are provided on the Compact Disk that accompanies the text.  Many of the applications are used throughout the text to permit comparison of complicated models with simpler models. A completely objective point of view is taken in assessing the merits of models and their range of applicability. The text includes an extensive Bibliography, a detailed Index and well thought out homework problems of varying degrees of difficulty.},

 abstract = {We study the minimization of objective func- tions containing non-physical jump discontinuities. These discontinuities arise when (partial) differential equations are discretized using non-constant methods and the resulting numerical solutions are used in com- puting the objective function. Although the functions may become discontinuous, gradient information may be computed at every point. Gradient information is computable everywhere since every point has an associ- ated discretization for which (semi) analytical sensitiv- ities can be calculated. Rather than the construction of global approximations using only function value infor- mation to overcome the discontinuities, we propose to use only the gradient information. We elaborate on the modifications of classical gradient based optimization algorithms for use in gradient-only approaches, and we then present gradient-only optimization strategies using both BFGS and a new spherical quadratic ap- proximation for sequential approximate optimization (SAO). We then use the BFGS and SAO algorithms to solve three problems of practical interest, both un- constrained and constrained.},

Such simulations therefore require numerical methods which can rapidly converge a boundary value problem, typically either the Euler or Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. In this chapter we outline two major approaches: time-marching methods built on top of Runge--Kutta time-stepping schemes and Newton--Krylov methods. A range of techniques for accelerating convergence are presented including local time-stepping, enthalpy damping, residual averaging, multigrid methods and preconditioning. More recent hybrid approaches such as the Runge--Kutta symmetric Gauss--Seidel are also discussed. The effectiveness of these methodologies, within the context of several Euler and RANS test cases, is also evaluated.},

 abstract = {ontinuous optimization problems of all sizes involve many of the same generic algorithmic paradigms, such as replacement of a difficult problem by a sequence of related but easier sub-problems. As optimization problems increase in size, however, certain standard techniques for smaller problems become inappropriate because of excessive requirements of time and/or storage. Furthermore, some approaches regarded as uncompetitive for small problems re-emerge as useful alternatives when problems become sufficiently large. Specialized high-performance computer architectures complicate the picture even more with respect to both viable linear algebraic sub-problems and algorithmic strategies. This paper will briefly discuss selected topics in large-scale optimization, with particular stress on issues associated with very expensive function evaluations.},

 abstract = {A set of implicit methods are proposed for a third-order hierarchical WENO reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin method for compressible flows on 3D hybrid grids. An attractive feature in these methods are the application of the Jacobian matrix based on the P1 element approximation, resulting in a huge reduction of memory requirement compared with DG (P2). Also, three approaches --- analytical derivation, divided differencing, and automatic differentiation (AD) are presented to construct the Jacobian matrix respectively, where the AD approach shows the best robustness. A variety of compressible flow problems are computed to demonstrate the fast convergence property of the implemented flow solver. Furthermore, an SPMD (single program, multiple data) programming paradigm based on MPI is proposed to achieve parallelism. The numerical results on complex geometries indicate that this low-storage implicit method can provide a viable and attractive DG solution for complicated flows of practical importance.},

 abstract = {Abstract Metamodels are widely used to facilitate the analysis and optimization of engineering systems that involve computationally expensive simulations. Kriging is a metamodelling technique that is well known for its ability to build surrogate models of responses with non-linear behaviour. However, the assumption of a stationary covariance structure underlying Kriging does not hold in situations where the level of smoothness of a response varies significantly. Although non-stationary Gaussian process models have been studied for years in statistics and geostatistics communities, this has largely been for physical experimental data in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, the non-stationary covariance structure is incorporated into Kriging modelling for computer simulations. To represent the non-stationary covariance structure, we adopt a non-linear mapping approach based on parameterized density functions. To avoid over-parameterizing for the high dimension problems typical of engineering design, we propose a modified version of the non-linear map approach, with a sparser, yet flexible, parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both mathematical and engineering examples. The robustness of the method is verified by testing multiple functions under various sampling settings. We also demonstrate that our method is effective in quantifying prediction uncertainty associated with the use of metamodels. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Over the past decades significant progress has been made with adjoint computational fluid dynamics solvers, which are an essential part of efficient high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimisation. Shape parametrisation is much less mature, in particular the field is lacking efficient and automatic CAD-based parametrisation methods. The paper proposes a novel CAD-based parametrisation with CAD in the design loop such that the CAD shape can ultimately serve as a datum surface in multi-disciplinary optimisation. Wing and fuselage are modelled with B-spline surfaces. The intersection line is calculated using an in-house implementation of a B-spline surface modeller and its derivative is efficiently calculated via finite differences. The proposed parametrisation method is applied to the redesign of the wing--fuselage junction of the DLR-F6 model using an adjoint solver based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations. The moving intersection line capability enables the fuselage surface to be deformed and the resulting intersection line to move along the fixed wing during optimisation. The flow separation in the wing--body junction is substantially suppressed by an improved fuselage shape, at the cost of O(10) steady-state flow and adjoint solutions. The proposed parametrisation method represents an important step towards automated CAD-based optimisation for fully-featured aircraft characterised by complex intersecting surfaces.},

 abstract = {In this paper, primal-dual methods for general nonconvex nonlinear optimization problems are considered. The proposed methods are exterior point type methods that permit primal variables to violate inequality constraints during the iterations. The methods are based on the exact penalty type transformation of inequality constraints and use a smooth approximation of the problem to form primal-dual iteration based on Newton's method as in usual primal-dual interior point methods. Global convergence and local superlinear/quadratic convergence of the proposed methods are proved. For global convergence, methods using line searches and trust region type searches are proposed. The trust region type method is tested with CUTEr problems and is shown to have similar efficiency to the primal-dual interior point method code IPOPT. It is also shown that the methods can be warm started easily, unlike interior point methods, and that the methods can be efficiently used in parametric programming problems.},

Two kinds of graphite/epoxy composite materials (T300/648-BF3/MEA and T300/634-DDS) with quite different matrix properties have been used. The study was done on two different layups, [({\^A}$\pm$30)3/902]s and [({\^A}$\pm$45)2/O2/902]s. Out-of-plane moir{\~A}{\copyright} interferometry and diiodomethane-enhanced X-radiography were used to detect delamination. A strength criterion for the onset of delaminatoin is proposed and an assessment made of the effect of matrix properties on delamination onset. A modified energy release rate model is presented for characterization of delamination growth emphasis being placed on assessing the behavior of delamination resistance curves and delamination growth rate. The results indicate that enhancement of matrix strength and ductility increases the critical loads for delamination onset and delamination resistance in the composite laminates under static loading, and significantly reduces the delamination growth rate under cyclic loading.},

 abstract = {The favorable convergence rates of Newton--Krylov-based solution algorithms have increased their popularity for computational fluid dynamics applications. Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly during the initial stages of convergence, particularly for three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulations. Addressing this problem requires the use of a globalization method such as pseudo-transient continuation, along with an approximate Newton--Krylov startup stage. This class of methods marches the solution  in pseudo-time with a matrix-based approximate Jacobian that has a lower bandwidth and better conditioning properties compared with the exact Jacobian. However, this matrix-based approach also has  shortcomings, including a large cost of computing and storing the approximate Jacobian and its preconditioner, along with the need for an updated Jacobian for every nonlinear iteration. To rectify these shortcomings, we  use herein approximate residual formulations in  a Jacobian-free approximate Newton--Krylov algorithm. With the approximate Jacobian, we compute the vector products  by using the approximate residual computations in a matrix-free manner while forming a preconditioner based on the matrix-based approximate Jacobian. This approach keeps the approximate Jacobian   up to date and  mitigates the cost of forming a matrix-based Jacobian and its preconditioner at each iteration by lagging the preconditioner between nonlinear iterations. We use varying levels of approximations with the matrix-free approach and thereby demonstrate the trade-off between rate of convergence and the cost of each nonlinear iteration. The proposed implementation  uses only the exact and approximate residual formulations and  can therefore be generalized with minimal additional implementation effort to a range of solvers and various discretizations.

 abstract = {Boundary layer ingestion (BLI) offers the potential for significant fuel burn reduction by exploiting strong aeropropulsive interactions. NASA's STARC-ABL concept uses an electrically powered BLI tail cone thruster on what is otherwise a conventional airframe. Despite this conventional airframe, aeropropulsive integration is critical to the performance of the BLI propulsor. In particular, the aeropropulsive integration of the BLI system must account for the variation in fan performance. Because it is electrically powered, the fan pressure ratio and efficiency of the BLI tail cone thruster vary widely across the flight envelope. Thus, accurate performance prediction for this novel propulsion configuration requires using a coupled aeropropulsive model across the flight envelope. In this work, we introduce a method to quantify the benefit of BLI at off-design conditions. We analyze the off-design performance of 18 optimized designs using an aeropropulsive model that is built with the OpenMDAO framework to couple 3-D RANS CFD simulations to 1-D thermodynamic cycle analyses. The designs are generated via high-fidelity aeropropulsive design optimizations for a range of fan pressure ratio and thrust values at the cruise conditions for the STARC-ABL concept. Performance analyses are then performed at a range of off-design flight conditions that span the flight envelope, including low-speed and low-altitude flight conditions. This study provides the first set of high-fidelity data for the STARC--ABL configuration at off-design conditions. The results quantify the power savings through BLI compared to a traditional propulsion system across the entire mission profile. Finally, the results and techniques from this study will guide the extension of current aeropropulsive design capabilities to multipoint design optimizations.},

@article{Yildirim2021b,
 abstract = {Aerodynamic shape optimization based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires three steps: updating the geometry based on the design variables, updating the CFD surface mesh for the new geometry, and updating the CFD volume mesh based on the new surface mesh. While there are many tools available for the first and third steps, the methods available for the second step are insufficient for geometries that have intersecting components. For these geometries, the CFD surface mesh needs to be updated near component intersections to conform to the component geometries and the updated intersection curves. To address this need, we introduce a method that can deform the CFD surface mesh nodes near component intersections. The method can handle arbitrary design changes for each intersecting component as long as the geometric topology is unchanged. Furthermore, the method is suitable for gradient-based optimization because it smoothly deforms every CFD surface node without introducing topological changes in the CFD surface mesh. In this paper, we detail each step of the proposed method and visualize the range of design changes that can be achieved with this approach. Finally, we use the proposed method in an aerodynamic shape optimization problem to optimize the wing-body intersection of the DLR-F6 configuration. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a high-fidelity design optimization framework. The method applies to both structured and unstructured CFD meshes and makes it possible to use computer-aided design and conceptual design geometry tools within high-fidelity design optimization.},

Parametric methods that commonly used nowadays are summarized in this paper, and their principles have been introduced briefly. Two-dimensional parametric methods include B-Spline method, Class/Shape function transformation method, Parametric Section method, Hicks-Henne method and Singular Value Decomposition method, and all of them have wide application in the design of the airfoil. This survey made a comparison among them to find out their abilities in the design of the airfoil, and the results show that the Singular Value Decomposition method has the best parametric accuracy. The development of three-dimensional parametric methods is limited, and the most popular one is the Free-form deformation method. Those methods extended from two-dimensional parametric methods have promising prospect in aircraft modeling. Since different parametric methods differ in their characteristics, real design process needs flexible choice among them to adapt to subsequent optimization procedure.},

 abstract = { AbstractComputer simulations often involve both qualitative and numerical inputs. Existing Gaussian process (GP) methods for handling this mainly assume a different response surface for each combination of levels of the qualitative factors and relate them via a multiresponse cross-covariance matrix. We introduce a substantially different approach that maps each qualitative factor to underlying numerical latent variables (LVs), with the mapped values estimated similarly to the other correlation parameters, and then uses any standard GP covariance function for numerical variables. This provides a parsimonious GP parameterization that treats qualitative factors the same as numerical variables and views them as affecting the response via similar physical mechanisms. This has strong physical justification, as the effects of a qualitative factor in any physics-based simulation model must always be due to some underlying numerical variables. Even when the underlying variables are many, sufficient dimension reduction arguments imply that their effects can be represented by a low-dimensional LV. This conjecture is supported by the superior predictive performance observed across a variety of examples. Moreover, the mapped LVs provide substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Supplementary materials for the article are available online.},

@article{ZhuBogy2002,
 abstract = {Air-bearing surface (ABS) designs that satisfy very strict multiobjective goals are of great importance for magnetic hard disk drives. Finding such optimal designs is a strongly nonlinear problem. In slider ABS optimization, the evaluation of the objective function for every sample design takes substantial computation time. It is desirable to reduce the number of sample designs evaluated without losing the global property of the optimization algorithm. In this paper, the DIRECT (DIviding RECTangle) optimization technique, which is a deterministic global optimization technique, was applied to slider ABS optimization. Results show that the DIRECT algorithm has a very fast convergence rate and it outperforms the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm.},

@article{Ziems2011,
 abstract = {We present a class of inexact adaptive multilevel trust-region SQP methods for the efficient solution of optimization problems governed by nonlinear PDEs. The algorithm starts with a coarse discretization of the underlying optimization problem and provides during the optimization process (1) implementable criteria for an adaptive refinement strategy of the current discretization based on local error estimators and (2) implementable accuracy requirements for iterative solvers of the linearized PDE and adjoint PDE on the current grid. We prove global convergence to a station- ary point of the infinite-dimensional problem. Moreover, we illustrate how the adaptive refinement strategy of the algorithm can be implemented by using existing reliable a posteriori error estimators for the state and the adjoint equations. Numerical results are presented.},

Our method is not decentralized, but easily scales to problems with 106 flows and links. We compare our method to a standard decentralized algo- rithm based on dual decomposition, and show by example that our method converges significantly faster for problems with congested networks or long routes. We describe an extension to problems that take into account delay or latency in the objective.},
