  abstract = {The feasibility of using scale model testing for predicting the full-scale behavior of flat composite coupons loaded in tension and beam-columns loaded in flexure is examined. Classical laws of similitude are applied to fabricate and test replica model specimens to identify scaling effects in the load response, strength, and mode of failure. Experiments were performed on graphite-epoxy composite specimens having different laminate stacking sequences and a range of scaled sizes. From the experiments it was deduced that the elastic response of scaled composite specimens was independent of size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among scaled specimens of certain laminate stacking se quences. A Weibull statistical model and a fracture mechanics based model were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the in fluence of absolute specimen size on strength. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.

@article{Brunton2013,
  abstract = {In this work, we cast Theodorsen's unsteady aerodynamic model into a general form that allows for the introduction of empirically determined quasi-steady and added-mass coefficients as well as an empirical Theodorsen function. An empirically determined Theodorsen model is constructed using data from direct numerical simulations of a flat plate pitching at low Reynolds number, Re = 100. Next, we develop low-dimensional, state-space realizations that are useful for either the classical Theodorsen lift model or the empirical model. The resulting model is parameterized by pitch-axis location and has physically meaningful states that isolate the effect of added-mass and quasi-steady forces, as well as the effect of the wake. A low-order approximation of Theodorsen's function is developed based on balanced truncation of a model fit to the analytical frequency response, and it is shown that this approximation outperforms other models from the literature. We demonstrate the utility of these state-space lift models by constructing a robust controller that tracks a reference lift coefficient by varying pitch angle while rejecting gust disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
