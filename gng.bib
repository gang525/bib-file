    abstract  = {Well-designed hydrofoils improve ship resistance and seakeeping by lifting the hull above the water.
                 With greater speeds come greater loads, and the two-way interaction of structural deflections of lifting surfaces on the hydrodynamics must be considered.
                 Tailored structural anisotropy can improve hydrodynamic and structural efficiency of lifting surfaces compared to rigid counterparts by exploiting the layup of composite materials.
                 Structural efficiency here means reduced risk of structural failure for a given amount of material, and hydrodynamic efficiency means lower drag.
                 A T-foil is a prototypical multi-component appendage, consisting of the foil wing and the strut, which we investigate in this work.
                 We use simple composite beam and lifting line theory to explore the static fluid-structure interaction of a composite T-foil for a variety of fiber angles.
                 We apply a simple approximation on lift coefficient at infinite Froude number ($Fn$) to model the free-surface effects, which is valid at high depth-based Froude numbers when $C_L$ is independent of $Fn_h$ and the inertial effects dominate.
                 Results for the moth rudder T-foil geometry studied here indicate that aligning composite fibers towards the leading edge results in a more hydrostructurally efficient foil and that free-surface effects are minor because of the large submergence for this flow condition.

For large-volume structures or structures with many component members, the only practical method to determine diffraction and radiation forces is to apply a boundary element method solver. This work presents the first known boundary element method solver with implicit analytic derivatives, allowing for total derivative computation alongside force evaluation. Two case studies are presented: a single floating circular column and a structure with multiple square columns attached to a horizontal pontoon. Force results from both case studies agree well with reference data, while derivative results agree with the best comparisons available. Computational requirements limit the applicability of this method and suggest further work is required to refine this approach.}

    abstract = {{Non-linear, planar wave trains have been simulated numerically using an efficient computational method. This method utilizes matrix diagonalization, based on multi-subdomains. The waves are created by a wavemaker at one end and followed to downtank distances, xl1 of 0(102). High resolution of wave shapes has been obtained. This numerical tank, LONGTANK, has been used to study non-linear sideband growth, strong group evolution, wave deformation, energy redistribution in the deformed waves, and jet formation (breaking). Comparisons of steepness at breaking and distance to breaking, as they depend on wave steepness, have been made, with excellent agreement. Similar agreement is shown between simulated and photographed wave shapes in the final stages of breaking. A criterion for the onset of breaking is suggested by the simulations.In connection with energetic waves in the ocean, there is now great interest in planar wave groups, and wave deformation and breaking within such groups (Tulin and Li, 1992). The nonlinear processes at work, leading to breakdown, are largely not susceptible to analysis. For the understanding of these processes, numerical simulation is therefore required. This is roughly 1 order of magnitude larger than numerical tank lengths achieved to date (Dommermuth et al, 1988; Grilli et al, 1989; Cointe, 1990). In these prior investigations, the waves were created by a wavemaker at one end and absorbed at a beach on the other. In Cointe, for example, approximately 400 nodes, over 10-15 wavelengths, were distributed on the free surface; the quadratic increase in computing time with tank length prevents longer computations. The waves are generated by a wavemaker at one end; a moving beach is placed beyond the front of the complete wave group, which is generated in time, and this beach damps the smaller fast waves beyond the front.}},
