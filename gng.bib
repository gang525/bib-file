@article{Smith2020,
  abstract = {The influence of fluid-structure interaction on cloud cavitation about a hydrofoil is investigated by comparing results from a relatively stiff reference hydrofoil, presented in Part 1, with those obtained on a geometrically identical flexible hydrofoil. Measurements were conducted with a chord-based Reynolds number for cavitation numbers, ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 while the hydrofoil was mounted at an incidence, of to the oncoming flow. Tip deformations and cavitation behaviour were recorded with synchronised force measurements utilising two high-speed cameras. The flexible composite hydrofoil was manufactured as a carbon/glass-epoxy hybrid structure with a lay-up sequence selected principally to consider spanwise bending deformations with no material-induced bend-twist coupling. Hydrodynamic bend-twist coupling is seen to result in nose-up twist deformations causing frequency modulation from the increase in cavity length. The lock-in phenomenon driven by re-entrant jet shedding observed on the stiff hydrofoil is also evident on the flexible hydrofoil at, but occurs between different modes. Flexibility is observed to accelerate cavitation regime transition with reducing. This is seen with the rapid growth and influence the shockwave instability has on the forces, deflections and cavitation behaviour on the flexible hydrofoil, suggesting structural behaviour plays a significant role in modifying cavity physics. The reduced stiffness causes secondary lock-in of the flexible hydrofoil's one-quarter sub-harmonic, at = 0.4. This leads to the most severe deflections observed in the conditions tested along with a shift in phase between normal force and tip deflection.},

Because gravity scales as the cube of the blade length, gravity loads become a constraining design factor for very large blades. Efforts to passively reduce turbulent loading has shown significant potential to reduce blade weight and capture more energy. Research in passive load reduction for wind turbines began at Sandia in the late 1990's and has moved from analytical studies to blade applications. This paper discusses the test results of two Sandia prototype research blades that incorporate load reduction techniques. The TX-100 is a 9-m long blade that induces bend-twist coupling with the use of off-axis carbon in the skin. The STAR blade is a 27-m long blade that induces bend-twist coupling by sweeping the blade in a geometric fashion.},

  abstract = {The load dependent deformation responses and complex failure mechanisms of self-adaptive composite propeller blades make the design, analysis, and scaling of these structures nontrivial. The objective of this work is to investigate and verify the dynamic similarity relationships for the hydroelastic response and potential failure mechanisms of self-adaptive composite marine propellers. A fully coupled, three-dimensional boundary element method-finite element method is used to compare the model and full-scale responses of a self-adaptive composite propeller. The effects of spatially varying inflow, transient sheet cavitation, and load-dependent blade deformation are considered. Three types of scaling are discussed: Reynolds scale, Froude scale, and Mach scale. The results show that Mach scaling, which requires the model inflow speed to be the same as the full scale, will lead to discrepancies in the spatial load distributions at low speeds due to differences in Froude number, but the differences between model and full-scale results become negligible at high speeds. Thus, Mach scaling is recommended for a composite marine propeller because it allows the same material and layering scheme to be used between the model and the full scale, leading to similar 3D stress distributions, and hence similar failure mechanisms, between the model and the full scale.

The geometry of these test objects varied in the spanwise direction (i.e. three-dimensional test objects). Closed cavities formed on these test objects. The interface of the closed cavities curved smoothly to form a re-entrant jet at the cavity terminus, and the re-entrant flow was directed spanwise, thus preventing its impingement on the cavity interface. The cavity shape and the pressure gradients near the closure of the closed cavities were qualitatively similar to those predicted with the two-dimensional free-streamline theory. These cavities had a steady, laminar flow reattachment. The flow around the closed cavity was largely irrotational.},

The baseline design uses e-glass unidirectional fibers in combination with ±45-degree and random mat layers for the skin and spar cap. This project involves developing structural finite element models of the baseline design and carbon hybrid designs with twist-bend coupling. All designs were evaluated for a unit load condition and two extreme wind conditions. The unit load condition was used to evaluate the static deflection, twist and twist-coupling parameter. Maximum deflections and strains were determined for the extreme wind conditions. Buckling eigenvalues were determined for a tip load condition. The results indicate that carbon fibers can be used to produce twist-coupled designs with comparable deflections, strains and buckling loads.

Classical laws of similitude are applied to fabricate and test replica model specimens to identify scaling effects in the load response, strength, and mode of failure. Experiments were performed on graphite-epoxy composite specimens having different laminate stacking sequences and a range of scaled sizes. From the experiments it was deduced that the elastic response of scaled composite specimens was independent of size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among scaled specimens of certain laminate stacking se quences. A Weibull statistical model and a fracture mechanics based model were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the in fluence of absolute specimen size on strength. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.

  abstract  = {Aerodynamic performance of biological flight characterized by the fluid structure interaction of a flapping wing and the surrounding fluid is affected by the wing flexibility. One of the main challenges to predict aerodynamic forces is that the wing shape and motion are a priori unknown. In this study, we derive an analytical fluid-structure interaction model for a chordwise flexible flapping two-dimensional airfoil in forward flight. A plunge motion is imposed on the rigid leading-edge (LE) of teardrop shape and the flexible tail dynamically deforms. The resulting unsteady aeroelasticity is modeled with the Euler-Bernoulli-Theodorsen equation under a small deformation assumption. The two-way coupling is realized by considering the trailing-edge deformation relative to the LE as passive pitch, affecting the unsteady aerodynamics. The resulting wing deformation and the aerodynamic performance including lift and thrust agree well with high-fidelity numerical results. Under the dynamic balance, the aeroelastic stiffness decreases, whereas the aeroelastic stiffness increases with the reduced frequency. A novel aeroelastic frequency ratio is derived, which scales with the wing deformation, lift, and thrust. Finally, the dynamic similarity between flapping in water and air is established.},

  abstract = {The physics associated with various cavitation regimes about a hydrofoil is investigated in a variable-pressure water tunnel using high-speed photography and synchronised force measurements. Experiments were conducted on a relatively stiff stainless steel hydrofoil at a chord-based Reynolds number, for cavitation numbers, ranging from 0.2 to 1.2, with the hydrofoil experiencing sheet, cloud and supercavitation regimes. The NACA0009 model of tapered planform was vertically mounted in a cantilevered configuration to a six-component force balance at an incidence, of to the oncoming flow. Tip deformations and cavitation behaviour were recorded with synchronised force measurements utilising two high-speed cameras mounted underneath and to the side of the test section. Break-up and shedding of an attached cavity was found to be due to either interfacial instabilities, re-entrant jet formation, shockwave propagation or a complex coupled mechanism, depending on. Three primary shedding modes are identified. The Type IIa and IIb re-entrant jet-driven oscillations exhibit a non-linear dependence on, decreasing in frequency with decreasing due to growth in the cavity length, and occur at higher values (Type IIa: 0.4-1.0; Type IIb: 0.7-0.9). Shockwave-driven Type I shedding occurs for lower values (0.3-0.6) with the oscillation frequency being practically independent of. The Type IIa oscillations locked in to the first sub-harmonic of the hydrofoil's first bending mode in water which has been modulated due to the reduced added mass of the vapour cavity.

An empirically determined Theodorsen model is constructed using data from direct numerical simulations of a flat plate pitching at low Reynolds number, Re = 100. Next, we develop low-dimensional, state-space realizations that are useful for either the classical Theodorsen lift model or the empirical model. The resulting model is parameterized by pitch-axis location and has physically meaningful states that isolate the effect of added-mass and quasi-steady forces, as well as the effect of the wake. A low-order approximation of Theodorsen's function is developed based on balanced truncation of a model fit to the analytical frequency response, and it is shown that this approximation outperforms other models from the literature. We demonstrate the utility of these state-space lift models by constructing a robust controller that tracks a reference lift coefficient by varying pitch angle while rejecting gust disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although scaling laws are well established for rigid propellers and turbines, relative little work has been shown for flexible marine rotors that are designed to interact with the surrounding flow. Considering recent interests in the development of large-scale, energy-efficient composite marine propellers and turbines, it is crucial to understand the scaling relationships to properly design and interpret model-scale studies. Explanations of the similarity requirements are presented, along with scaling factors for the various fluid and structural parameters that control the dynamic interactions between the flexible rotor and the surrounding flow. Finally, numerical results obtained using a fully coupled, three-dimensional, boundary element method-finite element method is shown to demonstrate the validity of theoretical scaling relationships and to investigate scaling effects. The results suggest that for most marine rotors where gravitational forces are negligible compared to other dominant forces and the boundary layer is fully turbulent, it is most practical to conduct model-scale experiments to satisfy Mach number similarity, even though the Mach number will be much less than one for most marine applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Different wave heading angles and wavelengths were adopted in regular wave test. In head wave condition, parametric rolling phenomena happened along with asymmetric slamming forces, the relationship between them was disclosed at first time. The impact forces on starboard and port sides showed alternating asymmetric periodic changes. In oblique wave condition, nonlinear springing and whipping responses were found. Since slamming phenomena occurred, high-frequency bending moments became an important part in total bending moments and whipping responses were found in small wavelength. The wavelength and head angle are varied to elucidate the relationship of springing/whipping loads and asymmetric impact. The distributions of peaks of horizontal and torsional loads show highly asymmetric property.}

@article{Spinosa2021,
  abstract        = {The water impact of an inclined flat plate and at high horizontal velocity is experimentally investigated with focus on the fluid-structure interaction aspects. Several test conditions have been examined by varying the vertical to horizontal velocity ratio, the pitch angle and the plate thickness. Measurements are performed in terms of strains, loads and local pressure. The study highlights the significant changes in the strains and, more in general, in the structural behaviour when varying the plate stiffness and the test conditions. For some of the test presented, permanent deformations are also found. The strong fluid-structure interaction is analysed by comparing the simultaneous measurements of strains and pressures, and it is shown that the deformation of the plate leads to a reduction of the pressure peak and to a corresponding pressure rise behind it. The variation in the shape of the spray root caused by the structural deformation are discussed based on both pressure measurements and underwater images. Despite the reduction of the pressure peak intensity, it is shown that the structural deformation leads to an increase in the total loading up to 50{\%} for the test conditions examined in this study.

A 3D time-domain hydroelasticity theory that includes memory-effect function considering Froude–Krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions, wave loads and slamming loads in long-crested irregular waves. In the hydroelasticity algorithm, the wave memory effects and forward speed effects are addressed by retardation function method to improve the computing efficiency and provide opportunity for short-term statistical analysis of ship responses in irregular waves. In addition, segmented model tank tests are conducted to experimentally investigate the motions and loads of ship sailing in long-crested irregular waves and also validate the numerical results. To further understand the nonlinear wave loads behavior of ship in short-crested waves, large-scale segmented model sea trials are performed in realistic sea waves. The numerical results and experimental results are systemically analyzed and compared using time series, spectral and probability statistical analysis methods.},

Classical laws of similitude are applied to fabricate and test replica model specimens to identify scaling effects in the load response, strength, and mode of failure. Experiments were performed on graphite-epoxy composite specimens having different laminate stacking sequences and a range of scaled sizes. From the experiments it was deduced that the elastic response of scaled composite specimens was independent of size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among scaled specimens of certain laminate stacking se quences. A Weibull statistical model and a fracture mechanics based model were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the in fluence of absolute specimen size on strength. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.

Four layups, (+ 30n/-30n/902n)s, (+ 45n/-45n/0n/90n)s, (90n/0n/90n/0n)s, and (+ 45n/-45n/ + 45n/-45n)s, were chosen with appropriate stacking sequences so as to highlight individual and interacting failure modes. Four scale sizes were selected for investigation, including full-scale size, 3/4, 2/4, and 1/4, with n equal to 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The full-scale specimen size was 32 plies thick as compared to 24, 16, and 8 plies for the 3/4, 2/4, and 1/4 specimen sizes, respectively. In general, large-size specimens exhibited a lower tensile strength. Fiber dominated layups were found to be less sensitive to scale effects compared to the matrix dominated layups. It has been observed that the presence of transverse ply cracks, which were associated with the ply thickness, were largely responsible for both strength and failure mode variations in different size specimens. In some cases, such cracks were found in virgin laminates, which meant that subscale models and full-scale laminates of the same layup were effectively dissimilar. {\textcopyright} 1992 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {The objective of this work is to develop and validate a coupled boundary element methodfinite element method to simulate the transient fluid-structure interaction response of tidal turbines subject to spatially varying inflow. The focus is on tidal turbines, although the methodology is also applicable for the analysis and design of wind turbines. An overview of the formulation for both the fluid and solid domains, and the fluid-structure interaction algorithms, is presented. The model is validated by comparing the predicted thrust and power measurements, as well as cavitation patterns, with experimental measurements and observations for an 800 mm marine current turbine presented in the work of Bahaj et al. (2007, "Power and Thrust Measurements of Marine Current Turbines Under Various Hydrodynamic Flow Conditions in a Cavitation Tunnel and a Towing Tank," Renewable Energy, 32, pp. 407-426). Additional numerical results are shown for the same turbine, but scaled up to 20 m in diameter, operating in a tidal boundary layer flow with a water depth of 30 m. The results show that transient cavitation will develop near the blade tip when the blades are near the free surface at highly-loaded off-design conditions, and the blades will undergo excessive deformation because of the high fluid loading and slender blade profile. The results also show that the natural frequencies of the blades are significantly reduced when operating in water, as compared with when operating in air, because of added-mass effects. In addition to demonstrating the need for proper consideration for fluid cavitation and structural response, current design challenges for both wind and tidal turbines are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

The scaling analysis considers the known underwater explosion physics, previously derived analytical solutions for the underwater shock response of a water-backed plate, and elastic beam behavior. To verify the scaling relations, the hydroelastic underwater shock response of an anisotropic composite plate at several different scales is modeled as a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem using the commercial Lagrangian finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. Following geometric and Mach similitude, as well as proper scaling of the FSI parameter, scaling relations for the structural natural frequencies, fluid and structural responses are demonstrated for a variety of structural boundary conditions (cantilevered, fixed-fixed, and pinned-pinned). The scaling analysis shows that the initial response scales properly for elastic marine structures, but the secondary bubble pulse reload caused by an underwater explosion does not follow the same scaling and may result in resonant response at full scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

  abstract        = {Accurate estimation of the added resistance and added power of a ship in waves is essential to ensure efficient and safe operations at sea. The objectives of this work are to (1) present an efficient means of predicting the added resistance and added power of the KRISO Container Ship (KCS) in regular head waves and (2) investigate the change in added resistance and added power with different wave conditions and model sizes. The predictions are obtained using a high-order boundary element method (BEM) called Aegir and a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, STAR-CCM+. Good comparison is observed between the predictions from Aegir, STAR-CCM+, and published experimental results for calm water resistance. The required CPU time for Aegir is found to be three orders of magnitude less than that of STAR-CCM+. Good agreement is also observed between the body motions and added resistance predicted using Aegir and published experimental results. STAR-CCM+ is used to find the calm water self-propulsion point for the KCS using a propeller body force actuator disk model. The results from Aegir's added resistance and STAR-CCM+'s calm water power simulations are used together to determine the added power of the KCS in regular, non-breaking head waves using the Resistance and Thrust Identity Method (RTIM). The added power prediction falls along the same trend line with variation in model length scale ratio. The maximum added resistance and added power both occur at a wavelength to ship length ratio of LLPPPP = 1.15, which is near the heave and pitch resonance conditions. The results show that the added power coefficients increase with decreasing model length scale ratio due to a reduction in advance coefficient and increase in torque coefficient caused by a higher relative contribution of viscous effects. The results demonstrate that the added power coefficients are not simply proportional to the square of the wave amplitude.},

Controller scaling is used to frequency-scale an existing controller for a large class of plants, eliminating the repetitive controller tuning process for plants that differ mainly in gain and bandwidth. Controller parameterization makes the controller parameters a function of a single variable, the loop-gain bandwidth, and greatly simplifies the tuning process. Practical optimization is defined by maximizing the bandwidth subject to the physical constraints, which determine the limiting factors in performance.
