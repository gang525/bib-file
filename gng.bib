@article{Spinosa2021,
  abstract  = {The water impact of an inclined flat plate and at high horizontal velocity is experimentally investigated with focus on the fluid-structure interaction aspects. Several test conditions have been examined by varying the vertical to horizontal velocity ratio, the pitch angle and the plate thickness. Measurements are performed in terms of strains, loads and local pressure. The study highlights the significant changes in the strains and, more in general, in the structural behaviour when varying the plate stiffness and the test conditions. For some of the test presented, permanent deformations are also found. The strong fluid-structure interaction is analysed by comparing the simultaneous measurements of strains and pressures, and it is shown that the deformation of the plate leads to a reduction of the pressure peak and to a corresponding pressure rise behind it. The variation in the shape of the spray root caused by the structural deformation are discussed based on both pressure measurements and underwater images. Despite the reduction of the pressure peak intensity, it is shown that the structural deformation leads to an increase in the total loading up to 50{\%} for the test conditions examined in this study. It is also observed that in presence of large structural deformations the hydrodynamic loads do not obey the scaling that works in the case of the thick plates, and some practical conclusions about the scaling of tests in presence of a strong fluid-structure interaction are provided.},

  abstract = {In this paper, wave-induced motions and loads of a bow flare ship advancing in harsh irregular waves are investigated both numerically and experimentally. A 3D time-domain hydroelasticity theory that includes memory-effect function considering Froude–Krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions, wave loads and slamming loads in long-crested irregular waves. In the hydroelasticity algorithm, the wave memory effects and forward speed effects are addressed by retardation function method to improve the computing efficiency and provide opportunity for short-term statistical analysis of ship responses in irregular waves. In addition, segmented model tank tests are conducted to experimentally investigate the motions and loads of ship sailing in long-crested irregular waves and also validate the numerical results. To further understand the nonlinear wave loads behavior of ship in short-crested waves, large-scale segmented model sea trials are performed in realistic sea waves. The numerical results and experimental results are systemically analyzed and compared using time series, spectral and probability statistical analysis methods.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of using scale model testing for predicting the full-scale behavior of flat composite coupons loaded in tension and beam-columns loaded in flexure is examined. Classical laws of similitude are applied to fabricate and test replica model specimens to identify scaling effects in the load response, strength, and mode of failure. Experiments were performed on graphite-epoxy composite specimens having different laminate stacking sequences and a range of scaled sizes. From the experiments it was deduced that the elastic response of scaled composite specimens was independent of size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among scaled specimens of certain laminate stacking se quences. A Weibull statistical model and a fracture mechanics based model were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the in fluence of absolute specimen size on strength. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.
